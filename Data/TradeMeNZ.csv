"November 12, 2019",1,Kaela Robben," Usually a good app for buying and selling, but last few days has been going super slow. Has periods of working nicely then will suddenly stop loading pictures and becomes laggy and frustrating to use. App is all up to date so not sure what is going on, please fix this!"
"October 31, 2019",1,Nam Kaewchui," It's becoming quite buggy especially when you are browsing through. 1) you find the same item again as you scroll down 2) when you click on an item and return back to the previous page you were browsing on, the items can change. Very slow and crashes."
"October 25, 2019",3,Paul P," All ok except when listing an item it skips the postage section. I have to start the auction then go back and edit it just to add the postage details. In "" Unsold"", it would be great to have a 'select all' button, then quick relist."
"October 22, 2019",4,Paul McKee, Good app but still a long way to go before it matches the web site. How about being able to search expired listings and a link to the message board please?
"November 10, 2019",1,Ezra Keddell, Used to be good. Now there's fees for every little thing and the value just isn't there any more. Better to use Facebook groups to sell things.
"October 22, 2019",1,Daniel Webster," Every time I try to buy something I'm told there is an error. Ap is fully updated and simply doesn't work. Worked for me a few weeks ago, had the same issue a few weeks before then."
"October 26, 2019",1,Vicky Campbell, Still can not do a decent search for boats. We want to be able to have more filters for example by hull type by make more length options.look at other boat sites to get ideas
"November 6, 2019",2,Karina Laurie," Since your update to ""fix bugs"" yesterday, I am unable to make a purchase due to the app crashing every single time I hit ""buy now"". Please fix this!"
"November 11, 2019",1,John Rippon," Keeps going slow, freezing, won't let me select stuff from drop-downs, etc. I'll use the web site thanks - much quicker."

Stops responding and exits when adding to watchlist, removing from watchlist, leaving a question, or answering a question Payment options arent displayed, many features are missing such as replying to feedback, disputing a sale, requesting refund, yet the help section doesnt mention they arent available on mobile. Its still good for browsing the marketplace but god help me if you want something"

"September 20, 2019",1,Michael Lang, The shorcut bar at the bottom is a nuisance.

"September 3, 2019",1,Feby Peter," Either give us fully functional app or stop forcing us to use app for some stuff, then mobile site for some other stuff sand then finally ""sorry you have to use our full desktop site"". It should be an option to open trademe links in the app, it shouldn't be forced in my opinion. Thanks."

Well theres someone in china selling 20,000. Local buy & sell sites are better. Trademe where kiwis buy and sell HA!"
"November 3, 2019",3,A, Many important functions are only available on the computer version.
"September 28, 2019",1,George Bristowe, As a whole app is ok. Worst feature is the search feature as it is hard to find what you are looking for as the search feature is really poor and lots of unnecessary items pop up under your search topic making your search for specific items frustrating.
"October 18, 2019",1,Elvin Law," The updates after version 40.0 is dumb, Hot keys are now at the bottom of the screen occupying it permanently. You are not making inprovements but rather gone backwards:("
"November 6, 2019",1,Simon jones, I've recently updated this app. And now the writing is too small. Help
"October 10, 2019",2,Code Name, Ping payment is a stupid idea. Did you guys do any usability study before launching it? Why should the user enter the password again and again? Why does it take 3 days to verify an account? Just a stupid upgrade. The development team should be ashamed.
"September 3, 2019",1,Dan Barton, Is there anyway to return to the previous version? Have never had a problem until this new unneeded and bugged update! Unresponsive and terrible layout!
"September 26, 2019",2,Anne Gray," I dont like the new site with watchlist etc at bottom of page. With the old site u could refine more, instead of having to exit site all the time."
"October 10, 2019",1,Dan Rollason," Slow, clunky, bloated. Full of foreign sellers peddling cheap junk steeply marked up with no way for buyers to rate those items. If your going to allow this you must have Product Reviews!"
"October 21, 2019",3,Jason Morgan, Viewing feedback needs to be made easier to use. You have to scroll through all feedback to look at the negative. Why can't you hit the negative to view it???
"August 24, 2019",1,Moca Brown, Before and after an update i missed three auctions! I spent an hour resetting my devices placing bids to no avail. This is some bs!

"October 14, 2019",3,Stephanie Bublitz, The app works well however the postage prices I think are ridiculous after years of trading on there I'm buying less and less as they put there postage prices up

It's really annoying how the app always returns to the main screen when you switch away from it though. If you are scrolling through a category and get distracted by a text message there's no way to resume where you left off without having to put in your search criteria and start hunting through all the listings again...

I did so with bank statements and driver's license. After which the admin Frankie told me afterwards that my credit card was not mine and that he did not want to help any more. terrible support for new customers.
"September 8, 2019",3,Kaia Ratema," App needs a ""remove history"" and ""remove from recently viewed"" button."
"July 29, 2019",1,Ryan Doidge," the latest app update is terrible. You search for a particular item such as a make and model Say your searching for a Toyota Hiace, you view one listing go back to your search and you are looking at clothes or pots or something completely irrelevant to what you searched for. Very frustrating!"
"June 9, 2019",2,Bob Sutton," Good for looking at items for sale and thats about it. Considering how much trademe charges they could at least wipe out a lot of the bugs in the app, like unable to edit vehical listings and other random stuff that happens when trying to list something."
"July 28, 2019",1,Chris Davies, So since the last update has happened when ever you search for something out of nowhere it will change what you searched for and add thousands of items to your search list. It's more frustrating than Facebook marketplace.
"July 26, 2019",2,Hayden Starrenburg," Latest update has really messed up the search function... Looking in cars, use the search bar to narrow the search and it's popping up with everything from pots and pans to books...

"July 28, 2019",1,Christopher ANDREWS, what the hell is going on with this app now..when I'm searching a specific search eg motorcycles sports bike ...after a short while it automatically goes back to a general search.. meaning I have to refine my search back to what I was looking at...this is terrible. sort it out would you !!
"July 9, 2019",1,Morgan Knox," latest update where menu options have moved to the bottom is rubbish. too much going on down the bottom now with android controls, refine and location options and now watchlist etc its 3 layers. Return to previous layout, worked great."
"August 18, 2019",1,adm-x 01101001, Wouldnt be so bad if you wernt deep in a list . Theres no going back once you press a button thats now permanently at the bottom where u'd expect another set of controls to be. Ye this pissing me off
"August 4, 2019",3,Weaken, Process of listing an item just takes too long too many pages to go through also still cant remove or arrange images in editing phase. Dont get me wrong app looks nicer but user interface could be a thousand times better.
"July 26, 2019",4,Kevin Wright, I've used the apple version of trademe and I still personally think it's better. the android version scales the pictures weirdly and the pictures in the notification panel are very blurry. Not sure if I need to tweak something.

As this should be sorted primarily, as their business has basically finished from their end once order has been sent, unless there are issues.

Many of which are outdated. Especially noticeable with electronics where a lot of subcategories have become irrelevant and unused due to age. - Incredibly shallow filter; this mainly shows in motors and electronics where you cannot filter multiple basic things at once (like filtering different car brands/models etc.) More effort please!
"December 18, 2018",4,Melanie Castle," This app is ALMOST perfect, and almost a replacement for the website. Firstly, you can't start a buynow only auction. Secondly, you can't customise all of the settings before the listing goes live, so you have to rush to change the settings before someone bids. Other than that, it's flawless."

Trademe Itself is a good design though selling things can be expensive. 8% Is a fair bit to think about when selling over a couple hundred. Problem it creates is overpriced goods to compensate the loss with success fees. I can sell a vehicle up to $4999 for $49 I believe, yet I sell, say a drone for $1650 I have to pay/lose $132.

"December 22, 2018",2,Rachel Warwick, Much prefer the older version !!! When listing an item I no longer get the option to add postage costs and options so have to go back and edit the auction before people place a bid! Also dislike the layout of my home screen and how categories I'm following are now displayed.

Love the App.... but why do I have to put my phone number in every time? Surely it could be a permanent option when it is being used. Setup in settings and the same with courier pick up instructions. Go into settings put in the phone number and instructions and set in the app, with a change link if you need to change it. Also I still can not select the purchasers name and address to copy and send to my label printer. I can either do the name without address or just the address. The other thing is that I come across address's that have to be changed. Wrong postcodes, wrongly inputed address. I thought that address verification would prevent it happening. If the courier to part could pick up an incorrect address why cant verification? Like I said I love the app. Use it for most things, but if you want to improve there's just a few things more."

Vertical scrolling menus works better when you're wanting to see multiple things at once without having your own time wasted.  I wouldn't have complained if there had been a way to customise my view back to something more logical for my Samsung phone as I do so much shopping on TradeMe. But this change is so hopelessly annoying that I will feel forced into switching to other online options.  This is no longer a phone user friendly app.  Suggest you fix this fast or I'm quitting.
"February 22, 2018",1,A Google user, The latest update makes the home screen too busy and uninspiring. I don't need reminding of what I've just looked at then see it more than once on the screen.

"February 19, 2018",1,Tony Godden, Changes for the sake of change isn't always best. Scrolling up and down was better because of the length of the phone screen you could see a lot more of what was coming up. Therefore faster to browse.

And the when I sit at my computer I have to download those same pictures from the cloud to list onto Trade Me from my PC. This is the only real frustrating thing about the app. Oh... and not being able to change profile information. I'm moving house soon and thought I'd change that info in my profile from the app, but cannot."
"November 29, 2017",2,Raymond Goh," Compared to the ios app, this is not very good. Doesn't notify you when your auction (selling) or fixed price offer has ended."
"February 9, 2018",2,Simon Biddle," Not content with revenue from trades, TradeMe has seen fit to have this app pop ads up on your lock screen. Pretty disgusted at their endless greed, and betrayal of their customer base. Uninstalled."

"November 30, 2017",1,Jonina Paraha, since update have found it very hard to use. hardly anything responds when i press on it.

"November 15, 2017",1,Adam Goulding," Glitchy and says ""oops something went wrong please try again later"""
"December 11, 2017",3,Tunisia Kaihau, It doesnt update after you place a bid you need to keep refreshing
"December 11, 2017",3,A Google user," Pretty good, sometimes listings dont display properly and the listing interface is a bit counterintuitive in the photo section but does the job"
"December 5, 2017",2,Steve Dawson, The new phone app is terrible you can only see one item at a time takes way longer to use
"January 15, 2018",2,Sandy Waterman, I type in item to search for and get unindated with other things that have nothing to do with what I'm searching for...so frustrating!  What's going on Trademe ??? it never used to be this bad !!
"December 9, 2017",3,Paul Timms, Category lists are to general and can't be refined enough and it has no back to my search button so you get taken back to the beginning of your search after looking at a listing.
"November 23, 2017",2,Roqmama Rox, Latest update sux. Glitchy. Slow. Not great to navigate. Put it back how it was.
"December 8, 2017",3,Mahi St, As my rating it's ok but I would add to star if quick relist will be aded to the app

We only have the 3 options of international, nth island n sth island at the mo  # 2  -  I love that they've FINALLY added down the bottom ""other things you may like"" into the app instead of just the desktop version, but it often shows you the same items over and over, and if you're searching a seller's full listings all it shows you on ""other things.."" is more of their stuff rather than other seller's similar items  # 3  -  If you win multiple auctions from 1 seller once the auction closes you can't bundle them together n pay by credit card all at once (only if you choose to add to cart before closing). Also, when you pick postage costs when bidding, once you win you cannot change it. So if you are combining postage you don't have the option to change the prices to suit,  ie: instead of paying full postage on all items full price for 1st item, free/$1 per item after that  # 4  -  If you want to check out a traders feedback, you cannot click on neutral/negative to just select those. You have to scroll thru ALL the feedback looking for a tiny wee face to see what/why they received a neutral or neg review.  Other than the above, I love TM n spend hours searching thru listings and always buy way more than I intended lol, it can be addictive  :D"

"October 25, 2017",1,Roy Hutchings, The feedback % are all over the place. I've looked at some traders with a 100% and they have heaps of negative feedback. Plus very hard to see if a feed back has beenough placed. The older version was better

"October 1, 2017",5,Julien Atkinson, I use trademe a lot and in general enjoy using it. Thankyou for fixing the recent searches function I no longer have to scroll to the bottom.  Also don't people pay enough already why be greedy and put ads everywhere?

The app has a great balance between powerful features and ease of use with care taken each step of the way. It simply has to be the best made app in New Zealand and even possibly the world.   I'm not talking about the trade me service here, just the app! But Trade Me itself is great too. This app makes me smile every time I open it. Well, besides the times I get outbid on things...  Great job, thanks for the awesome app :)  Btw, the ability to add recent searches as favorites directly from that screen or something would be amazing!!!! Handy for lazy people like me :P Cheers"

If we wanted to buy via international sellers we'd use international trading websites such as ebay or aliexpress. The lure for trademe was the national aspect of it. We don't want to work out what the price may be, we don't want to deal with international sellers, and we don't want to wait extended amounts of shipping times. Seriously dissapointed and I will never allow my fees to go towards an app who doesn't have the customers best interest at heart. You won't hear from me or my money ever again! Disgusting"

Only the video can be watched, with photos unable to be accessed or viewed. Quite annoying.  Prefer this app because of the saved searches on the home screen. A couple of times a day I open it up and check for new listings on a few 'recent searches' (different geographies, sorted by latest listings). The tiled display also highlights new listings easily as it changes to display most recent in thumbnail form. It's just more convenient and user friendly. I only really use the green app to search an area for listings if I am not up to date."

Trademe is already on thin ice with me due to their increasingly high fees.  This app BS is another nail in the coffin. Take note Trademe. Updated 17/12/2016: good work trademe. Thanks for taking note!

"October 18, 2014",2,Jaye George,O.k but could be heaps better. I tend to use desktop version most of the time Because a lot of listings don't show up on the app version & I also don't like how you can't just go back to the last page you were on it didn't do this before the update. Some of the updates that are done are worse.

"April 22, 2014",1,Shane Law,Update rubbish The site was much better before. How do I get the old version back?
"April 23, 2014",3,Kimberley Dick, Now has payment instructions! But what the hells the point if we still cant copy acc numbers or reference numbers off of the  app?

"April 13, 2014",3,Jon Bielby,"Ok, still some bugs Good effort, but it is still easier to list items from main website. A few bugs noticed on the first time using it so it seems like it hadn't been tested thoroughly."
"April 13, 2014",1,Dennis Angelo,doing it faster? the latest update with the refine tab is slow. i have to do 3 clicks the refine my search. the bar on bottom occupies lots of space and should probably only appear if i want to filter.
"April 13, 2014",1,Kester Vos,Terrible Don't let a 5 year old make this app anymore it was fine until you started to mess it up when I go into a category and find a listing when I try to back out it sends me straight back to the start you must fix this immediately
"April 12, 2014",2,Miles Lacanilao,Nice layout Easy to use app and nicely laid out. The only problem is that is continually stuck loading pages and i have to close and reopen it to get it working again.
"April 14, 2014",4,Lesha C,"Great App One thing is missing, being able to sort in sellers listings also when searching for items in a reigon like wellington it would be cool to be able to only search a certain area of that reigon. Otherewise perfect."
"April 11, 2014",3,Ryan Evison," Compared to the iOS version, it has obvious problems. Very laggy when scrolling through items and having the swipe (L/R) to add/remove from the watch list would be handy. Reviewed using an S4."
"April 14, 2014",1,Cameron Freeson, Terrible nothing loads and searching for items is confusing and complicated. Liked it before the update. Keep it simple!

"March 20, 2014",3,Thomas Cartel,More filtering options please This app lacks the ability to filter rental properties based on pets allowed/negotiable versus no pets. Highly annoying to go through every single property when 431 are listed in a singls suburb.

Bar the notifications this app is average.

"February 13, 2014",4,Ben Marett,"Great app Just a few tweaks to perfect. One annoying one is when you filter your search by category, price etc and go into a listing, when you go back, you lose the filters and must reapply them. Gets a bit tedious after a few times. Otherwise great."
"February 23, 2014",3,Rebekah Bills-Strange,Yeah its alright Have been having a few problems with the app crashing every time I try and select a category for a new listing. Its an alright app for when you're out and about but I feel it still needs some work to make it less frustrating to use.

"November 1, 2013",2,Vanna K,size catagories??? I loved this app before the sub catagories for the clothing disappeared. Now you must scroll through every item listed and hope to find the right size. LAME! Il change rating when it goes back to normal.
"November 1, 2013",2,Shem Watson,Get better Cannot view phone numbers of sellers with app making it rather difficult to enquire. I understand that trade me would prefer all users to msg through the site but this is a little unrealistic when needing to contact sellers for details on items such as motor vehicles
"October 24, 2013",2,Nikki Liz,Slow The application is slow. It was working fine until I updated. Please fix because I'm missing out. Main fault is it is very slow at loading. Fix ASAP

"October 21, 2013",3,Alastair Wild,Not enough info Is hard to get the info you need with a quick look. Web through phone works much better
"November 2, 2013",4,Rory Stephenson,Good It's frustrating not being able to see much of the detail on the main website in the app. A good example being the number of watchers on your auctions
"November 13, 2013",1,Awa,Laaame There's no sub catergorys anymore......this needs to be fixed as it is annoying having to scroll through all listings and the larger pics take longer to load

"August 28, 2013",1,Rhys Meredith,Latest update Why the requirement to have the ability to access and dial numbers in my contact list? Uninstalling.
"August 16, 2013",4,Kyle E,Good app It's a good app but I would like to see the feature to see the buyer or sellers feedback and not just the percentage just like the apple one has.
"August 26, 2013",3,Bonnie Lee,? Unable to use the email seller option
"August 27, 2013",1,A Google user,. Why so many permissions?  Ergg do you need to directly call phone numbers?

"July 22, 2013",5,Gina Harris,so handy glad we can now add listings  although being able to edit listings add buy now etc would be handy would be great to complete buy now and paynow all at once via app
"August 21, 2013",3,Cherrie Haurua,Good. Could be better. I like this app and it proves to be convenient. However more features such as closing soon/ hot listing or $1 resereve would make a more pleasurable experience

Therefore can't copy address for houses for sale and paste into Google maps seeing as you don't provide a nice click on address and goto Google maps.

The login screen is very poor, the use of real estate has not been thought out well.  There is no transition between activities/views which is just unacceptable for any decent native app, OverridePendingTransition() is your friend lead developer.  The button of shame is unforgiveable, please remove it's as simple as using targetSDK.  The actionbar on the splash screen is all wrong, the logo has touch feedback but doesn't do anything.  Search needs to be moved to the actionbar instead of taking up it's own space.  The browse categories page is a little better with the proper placement of search, but why there's an animation in of the search bar with the box looks like someone was just playing and thought it was a good idea.  The kiwi needs the back button to clearly call out up navigation.  On navigating to a selection from categories, there's now a third search option a button at the bottom of the view???  3 disparate implementations of search is just a cognitive speed bump.  Simply sticking to the guidelines will vastly improve this app."

Most features of the trademe Web site don't show up in the app.  It's a million times easier to just use the full website with the internet browser on Ur phone. Get some better IT guy's cause whoever made this app is a tool.

"January 25, 2013",4,Jungsoo Kim,Highly recommended Very well design and as fluid as the one on iOS. But one complaint is that the login speed. It takes way longer than the iOS version. Please fix it then it will get 5 stars

"August 13, 2012",1,A Google user,"New update not good unfortunately the new update had caused many problems. no photos uploading, catagories empty with no listings, keeps forcing close. otherwise love that I can now list items. once this bug is fixed I will change my star level."
"August 26, 2012",2,A Google user,"Needs some love It's OK for browsing auctions, but listing is a nightmare with crashes after uploading each photo. The interface for responding to questions means that you end up posting a comment rather than a reply. Better tablet support would be nice too."
"August 30, 2012",2,A Google user,Terrible Limited features compared to iphone app. Basic search filters.
"August 22, 2012",3,A Google user," Good but for Search, still get stuck with keyboard in search results.

"August 13, 2012",2,A Google user,Bad Realestate The app dosent have all the search options that work for real estate instead of price range etc it gives me buy now etc which dosent work if looking at rentals.

Here all I can do is browse and check my watch list. it doesn't even open the items I am selling even though there is a link to it. Will give more stars one there is an update allowing listing and the selling items link starts working *update* the latest update has made the app much smoother and all features seem to be working well now
"August 16, 2012",5,A Google user,"Fantastic Title says it all. If u have a android it makes it simple 2 look at what u want. I reccomend it. For those who want to delete from lost, just click + to put in watchlist then delete from there, easy. I wont upgrade tho till i c a big improvement 2 wat i am c-ing now."
"March 31, 2012",3,A Google user,The Good app but room for improvement Great app but would be better if allowed installation on SD card. Also doesn't show favorite searches. It's their first shot so I'm sure enhancements will be coming on future releases. Keep up the good work.
"June 17, 2012",2,A Google user,"Average Very difficult to narrow down searches especially in realestate, its pointless unless you want a house anywhere in the country and are not fussed between renting and buying because you cant choose one. Going back to the website. Good however to keep track of your auctions."
"July 7, 2012",3,A Google user,"Average Not up to par with the iphone app. Cant check other traders feedback, and when people are bidding on my auction I cant see last 10 bids. This app is still very limited."
"August 9, 2012",2,A Google user,Still bug infested but it has potential Crashes and a bit slow even on a s3. Needs more functionality like remembering your search filters and page location when you return to your search results.   I would expect more from Trade Me
"June 20, 2012",2,A Google user,"Freezes alot Trade me app flips out and freezes almost every time i use it and closes down, it drives me crazy. Good to have access to my account on my phone though."

Plus the limited ability you have for auctions is undesirable to me.id like to be able to edit an auction on the go..but no dice. 2 out off 5 for sure.
"March 5, 2012",2,A Google user,"Incomplete. still getting forced close issue on galaxy s2, maybe related to fast scrolling? also in the watchlist it shows the location of the seller/item but will not show once opened."
"June 8, 2012",1,A Google user,"Frustrating Not enough options to filter searches,especially in the real estate section. You can only filter by city,not suburb so too much of a pain to bother."
"May 17, 2012",3,A Google user,"Great Ap.. with issues :/ I love this ap and use it all the time!! but I hate force close force close all the time. And you can't read others peoples feedback it only tells you there rating. Could do with a link to sellers other items and a link to yoyr feedback,but good ap just fix the flaws.. please :)"
"April 14, 2012",1,A Google user,Acer A500 Huawei x5 Uninstalled on the A500 the website is much better with more features and you don't have to log in all the time. X5 need zoom on photos and where is the car and boat catagory.  General gripe Trademe has become so expensive I hardly use it nowdays.
"June 15, 2012",2,A Google user,"Average Keeps logging u out if the network times out during login. Could do with a ""remember me"" function as will generally be used with only 1 account."
"April 25, 2012",1,A Google user,wtf everytime i try to  log in it says there is an error...i can log in on all other devices using the same username and password but there is something wrong with the app.  i use the same app on my Iphone with no issues...
"March 5, 2012",2,A Google user,Could be better Nearly there but needs more work. No advanced property search options... doubt I'm gonna spend my time looking at all houses for sale in Auckland. Off to go find a PC now...
"July 14, 2012",3,A Google user,Very basic Cant delete items if you lost the auction which is annoying. Would be good to take a photo from phone and upload straight from it to trade me. Only useful for keeping tabs on auctions and bidding but not much else
"June 5, 2012",3,A Google user,It's handy However it could do with some more.. Like someone mentioned you can't view the Sellers other listings and also the about this seller button doesn't work. also can't really use to search for property.
"June 16, 2013",1,A Google user,Horrible :( Shut down my phone and got into some of my private information. Download this app is you want the internet sharing out your private stuff out.
"August 2, 2012",1,A Google user, Full of bugs. Annoying. Can't back out of pages without having to close internet down. Can't get feedback comments on members.	Seemed good until I tried to ask the seller a question then the program  encountered an error. Needs looking at
"May 26, 2012",1,A Google user,"Rubbish!!! This app is absolute rubbish, tried several different internet connections and nothing but failed attempts at logging in! Tried logging in via a webpage using the browser bingo works fine!!! Dont waste your time and data downloading this!"
"May 7, 2012",1,A Google user,Samsung galaxy 8.9 tab Dosnt work wont let me log on..keeps saying error try again. I did many times over many days. Trademe awesome!! App needs overhaul.
"June 23, 2012",4,A Google user,Give us list item The same iPhone app has list item. My S3 can handle more than a junky iPhone.
"March 15, 2012",5,A Google user,Good Cmon people stop complaining. This is a good app for trademe users. Not perfect but i'm sure they will make it better over time.
"September 21, 2012",4,A Google user,Love it hate it Its great progrem runs really good and i love how i can bid and check on my auctions from anywere. But few problems suck us u cant zoom on the photos and few other small problems
"March 23, 2012",2,A Google user,"Not quite Good idea and real handy for checking watchlists. Lost auctions need to let you know if item has been relisted. Also, can't search. Can type in my search but that's where it ends."
"July 8, 2012",5,A Google user,"Surprisingly good Well laid out, fast, and does the things you might want to do on a phone while out and about and in a hurry. Stays logged in. I would like to see it better optimised for widescreen phones/tablets in landscape but not a biggie."
"October 7, 2012",1,A Google user,"Rubbish Time to listen to all your customers telling u the app is rubbish. Unclear why you would provide an app with such limited functions, functions your customers use everyday on the website. Need to spend a few bucks getting it right."
"March 10, 2012",5,A Google user,"I love it! This is a great app but every time I scroll to the bottom of my watchlist it crashes, i hope this will be fixed in the future but I still use it every day :-). I have a Motorola Defy if it helps"
"August 17, 2013",3,Geoff Wade,Great app but needs all options available to pc users Desperately needs view sellers other listings opton. Also need to be able to see exactly when auctions are closing not just a rough idea in the closing hours
"July 5, 2012",2,A Google user,hard to use can't get sub categories for property sales. hard to use! would rather use website
"July 6, 2012",4,A Google user,Good Handy app. One thing i did notice tho was when i won a auction the total price was wrong. The item price and postage price did not add up right.
"June 4, 2012",3,A Google user,"Sucks The app crashed. Nothing on the apple ap cant list of veiw auctions properly, then the ap crashed and wouldnt do anything, how about we wait until they get it right."
"March 12, 2012",2,A Google user,"Needs work! Still appears to be only a basic version of trade me compared to web, needs an update!"
"September 5, 2012",1,A Google user,"jeremy terrible app. Dont download, much easier to use website so u can use full search options. very hard to search property and others. when selling it is useless."
"August 12, 2012",2,A Google user,Doesn't show all listings Android has a problem showing all listings. Seems to be stuck on some sort of search filter
"July 8, 2012",2,A Google user,Stick with the mobile site The touch website has more features than the app. Really disappointed in the search and filter options.
"May 16, 2012",4,A Google user,Great but needs a few changes App is well designed but a few improvements I would recommend. 1. Being able to choose areas within the regions when looking at real estate and 2. Being able to see who is bidding on the auctions that I'm running.
"March 11, 2012",1,A Google user,Buy only? Seems a bit weak if I can't manage my own auctions or answer questions. Flawed with inability to realist and can add closed auctions to your watch list?!
"May 4, 2012",2,A Google user,Needs some adjustments Needs a link to sellers other items and feedback etc and be able to asked people to relist etc and better searching for property like the iPhone app has where u can search the areas better other than that it's ok
"September 29, 2012",3,A Google user,Not quite There yet. Almost pointless without a shoot and sell option. I will change feedback once the app is finished. Half the stars for half an app.
"June 26, 2012",1,A Google user,Can't log in Keeps telling me login failed try again. Works fine when I login through the internet. Waste of time.
"November 4, 2012",1,A Google user,"Search Uselsss seach and browsing. Back button needs to take u to the immediate page before, but takes u all the way back. Wastes so much time doing the samething ovr and ovr again. Please fix and update!!"

"April 25, 2012",3,A Google user,"Decent app A good app, but still need to use website to complete purchases & other things. So really its limited. Hoping for some more updates so you can list stuff through the app, pay people through it, basically the ebay app is one to learn from"
"May 5, 2012",2,A Google user,Limited Just a heavily functionaly restricted version of the website. Can't see any use for it in current state.
"July 1, 2012",1,A Google user,Disapointing Not enough options and search doesnt work half the time.  Expected better from trademe.
"April 6, 2012",3,A Google user,great...but missing functions would love top/hot auctions and $1 reserve categories. Also not enough filters for some categories. otherwise good
"March 3, 2012",1,A Google user,Good when it works Latest update does not resolve crashing issues. Annoying. S2.
"March 4, 2012",4,A Google user,Love it It's a great app but could be improved by adding an option of being able to look at a sellers other listings (:
"May 2, 2012",5,A Google user,Real good Real good. I was not expecting it to work so well on Android. I have seen ios version and it has same functionality and features. Well done guys...
"March 19, 2012",1,A Google user,bit crap seems to work when it feels like it. needs a good polish before it will be worth using.
"April 7, 2012",1,A Google user,"Doesn't work I've tried installing this half a dozen times but it just won't let me sign in which is frustrating. Going via your browser isn't ideal either as you can't limit your search  to a particular location, look at bid history etc."
"June 22, 2012",3,A Google user,. I would like to be able to see the region/suburb people are in instead of just seeing the city. Super annoying for pick ups.
"July 13, 2012",1,A Google user,Bad Incredibly poor search function. Really only good for placing bids.
"August 8, 2012",1,A Google user,"Update doesn't work New update for S3 doesn't work crashes every time you try to open app, thought this would have been tested before being rolled out. Trademe get it together."

"March 13, 2013",2,Anthony Mullen,"Avg Works fine on my HTC Sensation, but on a Galaxy Tab2 it keeps coming up with ""problem with trade me connecting to the server"" which is really annoying. Have removed the app & re-installed, still no luck"
"July 27, 2012",3,A Google user,"I like it but.... There are a number of problems with it. The most annoying one I think is that no cell numbers are displayed!!! That totally defeats the point of using the app, particularly if you're looking at buying a car or moving house."

"March 26, 2012",4,A Google user,Almost great... Fast and fluid. An easy app to get to grips with. However I can't seem to edit my listings? More functionality from a seller point of view would make it 5 star worthy.

"August 8, 2012",1,A Google user,Useless! Installed on my s3 and now it doesn't work. Tm need some real programmers!
"August 8, 2012",1,A Google user,"Crashes ever since update the app crashes when you try open, DON'T UPDATE!"
"March 18, 2012",2,A Google user,"Good start Still has a long way to go, the constant crashing and force closures are very surprising from a company who has the resourse to get it right straight out of the box"
"March 8, 2012",2,A Google user,"Good but not great. Would be nice to be able to delete items from lists, I.e to delete from the lost items and unsold etc."
"June 20, 2012",5,A Google user,Good but... doesn't show what you're selling and you can't get extra information if you have brought something such as payment instructions etc. Its good if you are just having i look.
"September 11, 2012",3,A Google user,"Okay for searching Decent app for browsing trademe but lacks serious ability to complete transactions; send payment/address details; PayNow, etc"
"September 15, 2012",1,A Google user,"more functions plz plz add list function, as I want to directly list something from my phone,rather than take photo first, transfer it into computer and upload it on trademe website."
"August 8, 2012",1,A Google user,"Why?! With the update, why do you need to have the ability to take photos / videos at any time?! Delete this & I'll rate higher (& update). Till then, no thanks!!"
"August 8, 2012",1,A Google user,Update Failed on htc Just had an update and now crashes on opening on htc desire c!
"June 25, 2012",4,A Google user,Great app I'd give it 5 stars if you could see unanswered questions waiting in the list of selling items and if you could comment on auctions within the app
"March 23, 2012",3,A Google user,Crashes a lot Seems to lock up while logging in during a poor internet connection
"March 24, 2012",2,A Google user,Search feature does not work on my android The viewing of pictures is glitchy
"October 19, 2012",3,A Google user,"Meh... Pretty ave app, but I prefer the O.G. Trademe mobile site, it has a few more features... but ya can't preview peoples ""other listings"" on either??"
"August 8, 2012",1,A Google user,"Not good New update has major techinical issues, was ok, now terrible"
"May 21, 2012",5,A Google user,"Great app Easy to use, fully functional app. As a free app, it actually exceeded my expectations. Been using it a while and I'm impressed. Has a great look and feel. As you'd expect I use it for checking auctions while I'm on the go or when I cbf turning the computer on. Definitely worth installing."
"August 30, 2012",3,A Google user,Ivan Will give you five stars when I can use the more stuff you might like option on my HTC one v.  Love trademe still tho
"August 8, 2012",1,A Google user,poor new update is crap.cant even open app without a force close
"March 11, 2012",2,A Google user,Trademe No sub categories in the property section. Searching for a rental in Auckland and u can't specify suburb or price???
"August 1, 2012",3,A Google user,Needs work App is useful but needs functionality equivalent to website access. Also it force closes every time I scroll to the end of the watched items list.
"April 18, 2012",1,A Google user,Its crap Tryed downloafing it twice and still wont let me in
"July 8, 2012",1,A Google user,"Are you serious? Like l really want to see 11,562 properties for sale in Auckland and not be able to filter by suburb, price or anything. Come on, seriously?"
"May 15, 2012",1,A Google user,"Buggy Too many bugs and force closes, novel idea, but needs more stability."
"March 11, 2012",4,A Google user,Pretty good But Tradedroid still slightly better as it can list sellers other items - often useful for judging who you're dealing with.
"October 4, 2012",1,A Google user,YOU BROKE IT It was good before the updated now it is rubbish dont update keep the old one
"February 10, 2013",3,A Google user,Nex minit Was cool as ice. Nex minit listing property not supported on android. So now just average
"June 1, 2012",4,A Google user,"no probs atm just dwnloadd this app,loving it at da mo.so much easier an dont have to keep expandn each page to read whats on it."
"June 7, 2012",4,A Google user,Awesome App Very good application. Its fast and user friendly. Could do with an option to view sellers other listings though. Good work. Looking forward to the update
"March 21, 2012",1,A Google user,"Gj This crap, unfriendly, annoying and doesn't seem to uninstall properly. Use the normal version!!"
"May 3, 2012",5,A Google user,Excellent! Very user friendly and fast. Makes it easy and handy to search and browse from my phone
"March 13, 2012",3,A Google user,Hmmm Still a heap of things missing that really need to be there!!
"April 3, 2012",2,A Google user,Below average On the right track. But only about 10% capability of the website.
"March 26, 2012",4,A Google user,"Handy Good for my own auctions, but I can't search for new ones!"
"June 15, 2012",1,A Google user,Cant log in... :-[ keep getting an error when i log in my email and password...dont know why coz i can log in with no problems on the browser... :'(
"July 8, 2012",1,A Google user,Terrible app What is the point in this app when the filters are so restrictive?
"April 22, 2012",1,A Google user,"Unusable Installed it, couldnt search, couldn't navigate by category, uninstalled it...."
"June 11, 2012",2,A Google user,Need to sell on it. You can't list anything on it
"April 8, 2012",4,A Google user,mostly gud great app for trade me to buy. next upgrade should be able to list items dat would b very helpful
"April 25, 2012",4,A Google user,Ok Quite boring looking i dnt lik the layout
"July 4, 2012",2,A Google user,"Need more improvement So far so good, but if there is an option to take photo n sell the item would be much much much better"
"April 9, 2012",3,A Google user,Not bad Needs a few extra features. You can't view a sellers other listings for instance. But otherwise it's not bad.  Looking forward to version 2.
"March 17, 2012",1,A Google user,Doesn't work. Another time waster trader :(
"April 22, 2012",3,A Google user,Installed on lg p 500 Okay for a start. Can't really edit anything. can't even delete won or lost auctions. needs to get better
"June 20, 2012",3,A Google user,Good but could be better Good app but needs alot of improvement like being able to edit your own listings and look at bidders other listings
"April 25, 2012",5,A Google user,"Perfect Works perfectly fine on my Asus Transformer Prime, and my Nexus One. Actually prefer to use the application rather than the website. :-)"
"May 1, 2012",1,A Google user,Awful Can't login? Pointless. HTC Flyer
"July 8, 2012",1,A Google user,Error logging in Will change rating to 5 once I can use this app again.
"August 8, 2012",1,A Google user,Dodgy Won't run on my galaxy s1

"April 24, 2012",3,A Google user,Handy Needs a few added options that are lacking from trade me site. Like the sellers other listings option.
"March 15, 2012",3,A Google user, Ok but not fully functional for sellers
"April 15, 2012",3,A Google user,Not logging in Keeps coming up with an error when i try to log in.
"March 19, 2012",3,A Google user,Can be good Will give more if you could see sellers other listings. Back to using website until this is added.
"August 9, 2012",1,A Google user,Nope!! Wont work on my xperia u.
"August 8, 2012",5,A Google user, 5stars because app wont start and instead I had to use the web which is way better. cheers
"July 23, 2012",2,A Google user,Could be better Very basic no options when searching properties to simple needs a lot of work to make the experience worthwhile
"April 28, 2012",2,A Google user,No listings This app needs development! Why is it that the iphone app can allow listings but the android app can't! Would be a 5/5 if it could!
"June 25, 2012",4,A Google user,"Good Doesn't show which items in your watch list, so still need web version for serious shopping."
"June 16, 2012",1,A Google user,Won't work Can't seem to download on the S3...
"August 15, 2012",3,A Google user,"Filters? Useful I suppose, but its filters make it pretty useless when looking for apartments."
"July 26, 2012",1,A Google user,"cannot login use the same user name and password to log in trademe, it works on my iphone, not my andriod device"
"March 18, 2012",4,A Google user,"Good app Its nice looking and seems good so far, but has forced closed a few times."
"July 7, 2012",4,A Google user,Fix please There is a bug where you exit the app and it will log you out of your account. Please fix this bug
"June 11, 2012",2,A Google user,Image loading issues still... Sort it out!!!
"March 10, 2012",4,A Google user,"Xperia mini pro The update is much better, all that it needs nw is a sell option/listing option (:"
"July 15, 2012",3,A Google user,error searching doesnt work
"April 14, 2012",5,A Google user,Good after update The official app is now the best after numerous improvements. Don't waste $ on other versions.
"June 8, 2012",2,A Google user,"COULD be 5 If they made the search function more advanced like the iPhone version, please update this."
"June 7, 2012",2,A Google user,Well laid out app Doesn't allow me to move to phone storage. So below average rating
"March 26, 2012",5,A Google user,One of the best aplns This is a great apln. Definitely one of the best and a huge improver from trade Droid. Well done guys. Recommend to everyone.
"August 9, 2012",4,A Google user,HTC Good app..however would be nice if one can see other listed items from the same person....

Can I not sign onto two devices under the same name because I have tried logging out of one and trying the other but still have the same problem....This is ridiculous TM.....SORT IT OUT!
"March 5, 2012",2,A Google user,Good App Just alot of force closes...fab idea too but needs improvements.
"March 3, 2012",4,A Google user,"Selling items? This new button doesn't work, gettin better tho"

"March 3, 2012",5,A Google user,"Great! Works really well now, loving the sellers features."

"March 2, 2012",4,A Google user,"Good start Much better with the new update, good work Trademe. I hope more features will be added though. The message board would be great!"
"March 2, 2012",4,A Google user, Has promise. But still needs added selling features etc. If it was like the EBAY app then they would be onto a winner
"March 1, 2012",3,A Google user,Jane I need to be able to sell things i can see u r slowly getting there but hurry up :-P
"March 1, 2012",4,A Google user, Can now see selling items
"March 1, 2012",5,A Google user,Useful Does what it says.
"March 1, 2012",4,A Google user,Helpful Very convenient
"March 2, 2012",4,A Google user,"Come on! Better, thank you."
"March 2, 2012",5,A Google user, Great...almost ready...
"March 2, 2012",5,A Google user,Good app Very helpful
"February 17, 2012",2,A Google user,"Still needs alot of work There is still alot of stuff that needs fixing or adding. For instance, there is a serious need for a Sell option, not just buy. Can you guys also let us see the other listings of a Seller? When I'm looking at a listing, I'd like the option to be able to see what else a person is selling."
"February 16, 2012",1,A Google user,"Woefully short of features I don't understand how many months after releasing the iPhone app, when you finally released your android apply its woefully incomplete! No selling section? Come on guys, after all this waiting, this is at best an alpha release. At least the UI is clean and simple - one star earned."
"February 18, 2012",1,A Google user,make it exactly like iphones app! keeps force closing on my galaxy s2! also can't search property suburb only city.. alot wrong with it.
"February 26, 2012",2,A Google user,trademe app incomplete and crash like a iphone app. need selling details. Better to just use the full version on mobile internet...got 4.3 inch scree.n no issues..viewing on galaxy note should be easier.
"February 15, 2012",1,A Google user,"Really just for browsing Doesn't have items you're selling, sold or favourites. Bit rubbish really. Uninstalling it and will have to make do with the website. Shame."
"February 27, 2012",4,A Google user,"Only one thing missing I want to be able to sort car listings by year! Otherwise, a brilliant app. The others that are giving this app a bad because they can't sell items should have read the app details first."
"February 27, 2012",1,A Google user,"Half done? Gets frustrating the ""force close"" coming up all the time. Can't see your own auctions, and can't list new ones. Be great if can sort out otherwise gunna remove. So close but yet so far.... Keep working on it"
"February 19, 2012",2,A Google user,"Needs improvement Cant view suburbs when searching properties, cant view a sellers other listings, cant even see your own listings. Many force close issues, would be a great app if you guys can fit this, make it better thane tradedroid. (Message board function would hurt LOL)"
"March 7, 2012",2,A Google user,Why can't I list?! Buyer features only which is unacceptable. Essentially an unfinished app. Full access is a must!
"February 16, 2012",2,A Google user,Nosey & memoryhog There is absolutely no need to know my GPS location. Network based would be sufficient. 1.6MB after moving to SD is way to much too.
"February 20, 2012",5,A Google user,"""O"" for Awesome Love it! Installed on my motorola defy without a hitch. Have now been using it for a number of days to follow & bid on a number of auctions and it's been flawless. I'm finally untethered from my pc."
"February 20, 2012",3,A Google user,"Good but could do with improvments! Pretty happy with the app, it needs 3 more things to make it great! 1.  Be able to see what you are selling 2. When touching about the seller, be able to see their other listings 3. Be able to swipe across whe n looking at photos, instead of indivigualy opening each photo"
"February 26, 2012",1,A Google user,Rubbish! Can't even view items you're selling! App clearly developed by iphone lovers!

"February 16, 2012",3,A Google user,"Nice but incomplete Works fast and is easy to use on my Sony Xperia X10. For buying it's good, no selling functions yet. Didn't filter category (I set it to ""used only"" and new items remained. Looks promising but still has more work to do to be up to the expected standard."
"February 19, 2012",1,A Google user,Very limited So far have only used for two minutes but I can't even get to my own listings. Why not? So far not so good.

"March 1, 2012",1,A Google user,Forced closure! Getting sick & tired of getting kicked off & forced to close only after 2 minutes. GRRRR!

"February 19, 2012",1,A Google user,Not good... Can't see my own listing at all.
"March 3, 2012",2,A Google user,Can't see my selling list - S2 I can't see what is selling/sold/has ended of my listings. I can only see my watchlist and what I'm buying??
"February 16, 2012",4,A Google user,"Nice app I like the app but could be a bit better, for example I would like to see the town not just regions in the listings. But so far I like it, much easier than to use the website all the time."
"February 16, 2012",4,A Google user,Good start It's a good start...clean and crisp and free....a bit more functionality would be nice and hopefully that will come soon....i like it.

"February 27, 2012",1,A Google user,"Poor, no functionality Just a port of the equally limited iOS app, doesn't allow you to do much other than browsing. Force closes just about every time I use it. Crap"
"February 20, 2012",4,A Google user,Very usable Much much better than the mobile website. Seems quite fast. Good layout and functionality.
"February 18, 2012",4,A Google user,"About time! Looking forward to future updates to keep inline with iOS version, but a good start nonetheless"
"February 24, 2012",1,A Google user,Useless if u want to sell I downloaded this so i can manage items im selling but it is only for bidders. No features for selling.

"February 21, 2012",1,A Google user,Useless Get some seller options and then it might be worth having.
"March 1, 2012",3,A Google user,Simple things Wheres the sellers other listings and even a link would be good to list something to sell
"February 23, 2012",2,A Google user,No seller options I can't keep track of the items I'm selling. Why on earth would you use this app over the browser site on your phone?
"March 19, 2012",3,A Google user,Plz fix Good App Forces close every time I open it an Wen using. Otherwise would be great! Plz fix!

For Shame TradeMe!!!!!  You could have done so much better with this!  Here's hoping that TM will read all these comments and fix it ASAP!"
"May 10, 2016",3,Khom Yin,"Room for improvement App version is easy to use. Although when buying, it would be good to narrow it down from region to a city like the website. For instance Bay of Plenty to TAURANGA. When I want to search for lstings in Tauranga, I don't want to see listings in Taupo."
"December 9, 2016",3,Mathew Forsman,Useful I like the app but I would like it more if I didn't have to use my computer to list things that I can't on the app. Don't know why that is but would be stoked if it was added. Cheers
"May 11, 2015",3,Megan Owen Jason Ham,Good app but don't want login I don't want to have to be logged in tobuse the app. Kids use the phone and I don't want them buying stuff. Would be great to be able to use app without logging in

"March 12, 2014",4,Amethyst Heta,"Need more Good.. Love the app, but I want to be able to search or filter the sellers listings so I don't have to look through their whole lost of items when I just want to find one thing. Thanks"
