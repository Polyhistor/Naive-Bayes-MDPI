It's not buffering as I am on fast fibre, other channels stream just fine as does 4K video on multiple devices. Come on TV3, sort it out.

Constantly having to restart it.

Bloody shocking."

PLEASE just design a non-frustrating app! It constantly drops (this never happens with the 3 other streaming apps i have). With Chromecast it doesn't register the eps you're up to or what you have watched in one ep. So when it drops it's SUPER fun watching 5 minutes of ads just to find out where you were. Why on EARTH can you not star or make a list of shows you want to watch! Why do i have to search for them each time! Stop automatically playing a show I might like! This sucks!

When trying to cast it takes so long to load, often comes up with 'retry', when it finally connects to chromecast it freezes and then plays in low quality. This has been an ongoing issue for as long as I can remember."
"November 6, 2019",1,Teacher Campbell, Keeps crashing and glitching constantly. I have given up on starting Three shows because it is too frustrating to try and catch up on shows you miss. Watching a 1 hours episode can take up 2 hours due to the glitching and having to rewatch the adverts when you restart the app.
"November 4, 2019",1,Mirinia McVay," Can anyone tell me how to uninstall this app from my laptop, It works okayish from my phone but it wont let me cast from my lappy and its always faulting out (as per others reviews ) Im over it and now just to be doubly annoying, There appears to be no 'uninstall' option. Annoying af"
"September 19, 2019",3,Sami," Overall I would give it an ""Ok"" I wish it would display when the next episode is due out(including time not just date), and I wish it would be easier to navigate. Doesn't compare to TVNZ on demand at all. It is fine for actually watching the content but not great."
"October 13, 2019",1,Tanya Douglas," This app is awful. It constantly stops working,buffers or restarts an episode from the beginning again, doesn't matter how far through you are. Today's ice had to uninstall & reinstall three times and I still can't watch what I want to watch. Being used via WiFi connection at home."
"November 2, 2019",1,Chloe Bingham, Can you guys please hurry up and fix this ridiculous excuse of a streaming app. Can't even watch 2 mins of a show without buffering. Then coming up with an error. Or starting from the beginning again...
"September 17, 2019",3,Beth S," It's not a bad app, but not being able to cast a livestream from the app but when you can cast everything else is a major let down. Especially when a lot of the Bravo shows are not available on demand."
"September 26, 2019",1,Lucia Williams," Still can't cast live tv. I don't understand why not? Tvnz can. This app just sits on my phone, unused until I decide to check it again and what do you know, still can't cast."
"October 3, 2019",1,Jacinta Hopkins, Videos stop and buffer or load every few minutes which makes watching tv almost impossible. We have fast internet speeds so its definitely the app. It would be infinitely better if you could select the playback resolution without so it wouldn't constantly stop video playback to reload HD.
"October 10, 2019",1,Kurt Trali," You can't actually complete account creation within the app. The sign up button remains dulled out and unresponsive. Tried: different names, password, year of birth, gender, adding the optional post code, and lastly force restarting the app and doing the above all over."
"October 2, 2019",1,Grace Wells," Glitches, stops working and restarts the episode so many times. I just want to watch MAFS but after 2 mins of watching it disconnects from my chrome cast and goes back to the beginning of the ep and I have to watch all the ads again. Not happy"
"September 8, 2019",1,nz22154," Absolutely terrible app, so frustrating. Fibre broadband and it buffers every second due to some issue which I have heard others also have. Fix it, this isn't acceptable in 2019!"
"September 16, 2019",1,Daniel Gibbs, I could get this channel with no problems before then when to update the app I can't get into open it keeps on saying try tap again but still won't allow me to get info it to watch anything im missing some of my programme's I have missed not happy
"October 4, 2019",1,Anne Kjaer," Plays 5 minutes, buffers 2 minutes. Often it stops in the middle of a show and starts from the beginning. No problems when using youtube or nztv on demand. Have given up watching threeNow."
"September 25, 2019",1,Kotuku Kaihau," App downloads but keeps saying retry when I try to use it, have deleted it and retried several times to install in the hope that one day it might actually be fixed, no stars would be more appropriate."
"September 5, 2019",2,Cary Hubert," Was a great app then all of a sudden it stopped allowing live tv to be cast to chromecast with the app shutting down as soon as you press play on the Channel you select, rest works fine.."
"November 10, 2019",2,Amy Stoner, I not to impressed ever since the update watching a movie or program is just impossible to watch cause it won't load properly when I click on the movie or program 😠😠😠
"September 8, 2019",3,Calem Bryan," Apps good, except for the fact you cant chromecast live tv, you guys need to sort this out and quick as it's a massive let down for the app!"
"September 11, 2019",1,Huatahi Rahi," I actually give 0 stars. Why have a cast button if you can't cast anything? Might as well go back to TVNZ On demand, atleast it'll cast when you press the cast button."
"November 5, 2019",1,rene michele nairn, Can't even log onto the app. Tap an retry. Does not work.
"October 5, 2019",5,raykz, Ti isna very good app i don't see why people say that is is all glitchy and saying that they have fibre why is this happening well maybe if you weren't using a potato as a phone it would work fine not just some 4 or 5 year old phone that can barely run google
"November 5, 2019",1,Gayle Henderson, Used to be able to watch threenow until I HAD to install their stupid app. Now I cannot get it to even open on my tablet so they have lost a veiwer. Totally useless
"September 9, 2019",2,Ashleigh Crighton, Live doesn't work. We didn't have our TV aerial so downloaded this for live TV and doesn't even work. Tried for 3 days now.
"October 6, 2019",5,Paul Geraghty," It great , but the last update every time try to watch a show it says playback error has been going on for about a week"
"October 9, 2019",1,Tonilee Hall, Why can't we cast live TV? It's really stupid that you can't. Also wondering why the app isn't available on PlayStation?
"September 15, 2019",2,T Houia, Good programs to watch. Glitchy. Constantly cutting out. Takes nearly 2 hours to watch a one hour show. Really poor platform.
"September 20, 2019",1,kiwiboysl, One of the worst apps on the Google play store. Do not download as you will spend hours trying to watch a simple show. It's easier to pirate the show than to use this.
"September 10, 2019",1,Sara Irving, Terrible app constantly buffering and takes twice as long to watch a show. Have no problems with TVNZ or Netflix so know that it's the app and not a network issue.
"September 30, 2019",2,Elisabeth Hince, App buffers a lot and doesn't compare well to other streaming apps. Quite frustrating no matter what device I use.
"September 17, 2019",3,Shane Hanson, Crashes when trying to cast live TV. Other shows are fine. Regretfully all I want is the news! Samsung J5.
"September 12, 2019",1,godj007, Bad. Samsung S8 from spark. Says it jail broken when it is NOT. So it won't work.
"September 26, 2019",1,Zumba with Hanna, Too slow/clunky! Often cuts out during the show. Then makes me watch more ads when I reload. Shame cause the content is good
"September 25, 2019",1,April Aranui, Bad experience still with this app can't get it working just keeps saying error with reaching you app I've tried to redownload the app and wait a day or two but still nothing just keeps saying cannot load playback
"September 14, 2019",1,Courtenay S," This app is garbage. Its slow, laggy and the videos are constanly buffering (and we have fibre internet for gods sake)."
"September 16, 2019",1,Fred Hickey, App cannot cast from mobile. Constant crashes and will never work. Fairly useless. No other app including TVNZ and Netflix function perfectly
"November 10, 2019",1,Janelle Keighley, I bought my phone from Harvey Norman yet this app insists it's a jailbroken device. It's not. This app will not work whatsoever
"September 16, 2019",2,Kerri Tamainu, Most annoying of all my TV apps. Can't chrome cast live TV but I can with TVNZ on demand.
"September 14, 2019",1,Angela anderson, Every time I download this app it won't let me do anything other than tap to retry.
"September 24, 2019",1,Chris Maguire, Crashes every time I try to launch Live TV via Chromecast. Other streaming apps work fine with Chromecast
"September 9, 2019",1,Johnny J," Glitchy on all programs even with a fibre connection. Audio is great while video lags continuously, how painful."
"September 23, 2019",1,John Hunter, Useless. Can't use live streaming tv on Chromecast. App just crashes.
"October 5, 2019",1,adam mccutcheon, Buggy. Can't rewind or skip forward. Does not accurately pick up where playback finished

"September 27, 2019",1,Ella Nordstrand, Casting on chrome cast doesn't work with this app.. Its glitchy.
"October 2, 2019",1,Grant Nelson, Cant get this app on smart tv .have to go through the phone and cast it to the tv

"September 18, 2019",1,Jason Lewis," Terrible. Mediaworks you're a big organisation this is shameful. The TV1 app casts in a few seconds, yours doesn't work, locks up etc. What a joke."
"September 27, 2019",1,Jon O'Brien, Don't bother - continually crashes.
"September 29, 2019",5,Tyler Green," Really surprised how well this app worked, works absolutely fine on my OnePlus 5T."
"September 8, 2019",1,Lorraine Sugrue, Stops all the time. Can't chromecast

Enough is enough, it's rediculous! I just want to catch up on shows I've missed, not watch ads all the time. PEASE change it so that there is an ad just before the episode and ONE halfway if you absolutely must have them."
"August 28, 2019",2,Alex Scott, Stops and starts for five minutes or so before it will play properly without stopping. Almost gave up trying to watch something but it will work if you persist. Seriously needs improvement though.
"September 3, 2019",3,Ranee Higgins," Trying to watch an episode, and half way through it starts to constantly buffer. It wont play for more than a few seconds. Try to stop/pause in order to allow it to load and it just makes it worse."

I get that ads equal revenue, but do they have to be so loud?"
"September 5, 2019",1,Lynda Klem, Very dissapointing. In the past I have always used this app but since the update when I select a show to watch it comes up with message 'tap to connect'. I have unistalled app and really installed but still the same. Please fix.

Shame on you indeed. instead all I can chromecast is what you list on demand. well thats no good if you want to watch live tv. well sadly I will have to revert back to tvnz on demand for live tv chromecast. they Atleast appear to have tested their app with no major issues. seriously what tv can cant chromecast live tv...hmmm tv3
"June 14, 2019",3,Carmen Mitchell, There seems to be an issue that has happened with the latest update. TV shows will play and come to the first set of ads and the show you are watching goes back to the beginning again. REALLY annoying. I wish you had a favorites list like other streaming apps.
"September 22, 2019",1,Matt Cole, App wont allow live feed to work. It just close app down

"August 24, 2019",1,Sandra Deearna, Not able to watch a single thing on here. Just as useless as tvnz on demand... but yet I can watch anything on YouTube with no problems. Gonna have to delete this app along with tvnz on demand app
"July 28, 2019",1,Jazman Ellery," Awful app. No ability to add series to favourites. Doesnt save what you were last watching and if it has it starts the episode from the beginning, cue 2 minutes of ads to watch 5 minutes before more ads. Clunky outdated and needs to catch up with the likes of TVNZ onDemand and Netflix"
"August 19, 2019",1,Feaomoeata Katoa, Unable to cast live TV via chromecast. I have uninstalled and reinstalled and still not having any luck. Please fix ASAP.
"May 27, 2019",2,Michael G," The fact that you still don't have the ability to cast live TV via a Chromecast is terrible when you can with on-demand. Should concentrate on adding basic features like that, which your competition has, instead of seeing how many ads you can serve before people quit your app in frustration."

"June 24, 2019",1,Kahn Wynyard," Cannot cast live tv through app, casting anything else works. This problem has been around for a while and needs to be fixed. I imagine people will change rating and start actually using the app properly when this is fixed."
"August 10, 2019",1,Emily Jade Westover," This app is terrible since the latest update. I can only watch live tv nothing on demand. Tells me to refresh and try again, I do this with no result. I uninstalled and reinstalled and still doesn't work. Very frustrating as it was working fine before the update."
"September 1, 2019",1,Lee Spence, Won't let me chromecast to my TV at all from my phone. App crashes whenever I try even though the app connects to the chrome cast itself.

"June 4, 2019",2,Bayley T, Very unpredictable if the app will work and when it does then at times will be playing via chromecast then it will cut out. As I have no line for TV this is the only way to catch up on certain shows and is very disappointing when doesn't work.
"August 6, 2019",1,kasey groundwater, Hate that the new update needs access to your location! Also super frustrating when you exit and then go back to watching your programme your HAVE to watch a whole new set of ads!!! No way of storing favourites either!? TVNZ on demand is way better!

But buffering is a big issue and the stream is far from smooth, almost like it's a low frame rate stream. So let's take away a star. I'm also finding it a major irritation that when you've watched a program you get returned to the main page. No option to watch the next episode, and no way to bookmark favourites, so you have to search again for the program you've just watched in order to carry on watching! Take away two stars.  Technically the app is ""adequate"", but the user interface and general experience is pretty dire. Take away another star.  The lack of personalisation (e.g. bookmarking favourites) makes it clear that the need to log in is only aimed at them gathering personal data for marketing/advertising, or for on-selling. Otherwise why not just let people watch without a login being set up? So take away another star. And what's with the volume of the ads? Be ready with that mute button because the normal volume level of the program you're watching changes to something that'll blow your speakers when the ads start. So take away a star. Yeah. Negative stars."

I have to wonder why the Threetards would even keep this app in the Play Store considering that it gets almost exclusively one star reviews. The app hasn't had a substantial update in years, the only thing it can stream properly is ads after unskippable ads, the actual content stream is prone to stopping, requiring you to go back to restart it and forcing you to sit through more ads. It takes twice as long to watch a program as its claimed running time."

"August 14, 2018",4,Jesse Cooper," App works well for me. Not sure why so many people are complaining about

"September 8, 2018",1,Peter Corin, In a world with so many great streaming services I can't believe how horrible this experience is. The worst thing for me is that when chromecasting shows they randomly restart forcing you to watch 2 ads before you can even start guessing where you were up to. Unbelievably horrible.

now i have to watch on my much less ideal phone. 3. TVNZ on demand has one 
ad at a time in breaks. You have 4, not only that but through at least 2 of 
these breaks now (im only partway through my show and already annoyed), 3 
of the 4 ads in a single break have been the same one repeated. I have seen 
the Air NZ ad about 6 times already during one show. 4. Went back to app 
after writing review to watch the rest of the how. Got 1 'ad' (AirNZ 
again), THEN another set of 4 started. Guess what, 3/4 WERE THE SAME AD 
AGAIN. YOU ARE KIDDING ME. SORT IT OUT."

If you switch to another app while watching something you often  have to exit altogether as it either won't resume playing at all or will do it from totally the wrong place.

"March 30, 2018",1,Redjandal 3, Ok at start. Had to uninstall usage overheating phone?!? Re-installed - now Media Works wants me to sign in?? Since when. TVONDEMAND don't have this nonsense...and btw your app still doesn't work you guys suck!
"April 30, 2018",1,A Google user," Just terrible. Very poor audio quality. Video quality also bad, unable to 
change settings. Also seems like a lot of long ads- which replay if you 
skip backwards or refresh. Also found the UI very unintuitive. Competitors 
are providing a much better service."

But now this app is frustrating as it keeps putting up a playback error tap here sign then when you tap the sign stays on the screen and the loading signal shows while the movie starts playing behind it. And it stays like this unless you go out of the movie and suffer ANOTHER ad coming in again. And what's with all the ads every time you pause the movie or have to go back out and come back on to movie. Aren't the ads through out the movie enough???? Why do we have to watch all these other ads too. It's more punishing than watching normal tv :-( But sometimes I miss something and I want to watch it :-(

Constantly playing 15 second adds consecutively and after two hours of trying to watch a 20 minute show. It still hasn't finished. Clearly regression testing was not conducted nor documented. Otherwise they would fix this issue. Or maybe they already know. They just don't wanna do anything about it. Shame on your dev team"
"September 28, 2017",1,Nostalgia," Please report this app.  It's an absolutely faulty mess.  You cant stream a thing without constant ads and massive playback error issues and thats not an overstatement. This is a broken app. Please Google/Apple remove this inflammatory, offensive app right now."
"July 31, 2017",1,A Google user," I have to say this is absolutely thee most hideous app ive ever used in my entire life. Took me 2 1/2 hours to watch a 1 hr show i missed tonight. Never write reviews on apps but i thought you had to know, just how pathetic this app is!"
"July 19, 2017",3,Joshua Mansill," Chromecast support is great but the fact you can't stream live TV this way is a big negative. It's a shame as the TVNZ app alows you to do it. Rather watch The AM Show than TVNZ One's Breakfast but without this feature, not possible."

"August 14, 2017",1,Keelan Heesterman," Ads always glitch the app. It sometimes plays more ads than it should,  sometimes plays the audio of an adult first the the video meaning you watch twice as much. Also, it sometimes continues playing a black screen while the time counts down. Nice looking app but very dysfunctional and glitchy"
"September 22, 2017",1,A Google user, What an annoying experience it is trying to watch a show with this app! The video never re-loads after add interference. Still havnt finished watching one episode after trying multiple times to do so. Sorry ThreeNow but your app is an absolute frustrating waste of time. Not worth it.
"October 1, 2017",1,Karl Buchanan," There is a massive demand for watching tv this way and quite simply the technoloy or effort in this is not there. There is no possible way you can  sit down and relax and watch content this way.   Unless you want to watch the same 4 adds over and over again, don't waste your time"

Whoever made this app really needs to reevaluate their career choices.
"August 13, 2017",1,Lisa Elliot," This is rubbish.  The adverts dont work properly.  it shows the start of an ad then black screen then the start of another ad.  Sometimes it never shows the tv programme, only small pieces of ad and lots of black screen."

"August 22, 2017",1,Holly Watson, Still constantly glitches and freezes. Starts playing adds. Then stops and starts again. Constant playback errors in middle of program. Worse app ever. Instead why don't you actually fix it to run smoothly instead of adding new features????
"July 20, 2017",1,Ange Elliot, Crashes constantly. Have to sit through so many adds after constantly restarting the app to try find where it crashed or it plays 15 adds in a row . So fustrating . Please fix !
"July 26, 2017",1,Kiwi Rambo," So irritating, you minimise the app and come back to it, eg texting or sending a sc, like you do on a phone. Only to come back to it and be forced to sit through a minute of ad's. Cmon guys"
"September 6, 2017",1,Lucchy Hutton, This app sucks sick of watching a show for it to keep stopping then u have to watch like 15 ads before it starts again an then after that it still doesn't work u go out of the app then go back in to watch another lot of ads this is stupid getting so sick of this app

The app itself is also terribly slow at anything but video playback. The biggest flaw though is the fact that it comes with a whole lotta cache backed up when you install it this leads the videos not playing and making the app useless, the only way around this is to clear the data."

"February 13, 2016",1,Alistair Owens,Breaches Trust and Privacy! The app works well but at a huge cost to privacy. It will scan any personal account profile data on your device as well as files and other stuff it does not need. If you are OK with this then it is a good app. Otherwise avoid like the plague!
