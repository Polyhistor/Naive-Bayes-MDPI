The butterflies are real species, the art and design are gorgeous, everything is in motion and feels alive, and the caterpillars are precious. I just came to give my 5star review because, aside from the game is just brilliant, dev team was quick to respond to me wanting to transfer my game between phones without social media and did so with no issues, so thank you for that! I only wish we could name our butterflies but that might be kind of chaotic"

But hey.. i got 2 suggestions.. 1: if you guys have control over the types of ads that are played. Could you not use interactive/playable ads with the -30 min because it doesn't work and is just a waste of time.. 2: Spider sanctuary... 🤩🤩 wouldn't that be dope???"
"September 23, 2019",4,Coast Canine," Flutter is such an adorable and addicting game! Although, I'm not sure whether this is from my phone or if it's a known problem, but very often when I'm navigating through the menus, it doesn't register when I tap and it exits the menu.

Although, I'm not sure whether this is from my phone or if it's a known problem, but very often when I'm navigating through the menus, it doesn't register when I tap and it exits the menu. It's gotten quite annoying, especially when I'm trying to fuse my flowers and check on what butterflies I've collected. So far, this is my only complaint, everything is beautiful."
"October 14, 2019",3,maya sanchez," It's a great way to pass the time, the graphics are nice and cute but the trouble you go through just to unlock one little part of the garden is ridiculous. 10/13/19 Removed a star because of the recurring issue with the stupid calendar. You guys really should get it together."
"October 21, 2019",4,Anna Bean," As an avid butterfly lover, I love this game, but it irritates me that the peacock butterfly's hindwings don't have the correct colouring and pattern - in reality they are very dark, almost black underneath, and resemble a dead leaf, not the same colours and patterns as on the top."
"October 28, 2019",5,Arthur Haze," I genuinely enjoy the game! It's relaxing, and learning about moths or butterflies has helped me surprise my fiance by talking about his special interest with him. It's a lovely game. The music is great, and everything is pretty straight forward."
"September 10, 2019",5,Ash Morris," I love this game but the current event is stupid.

The way you get flowers is horrible as you get them when you collect honeydew BUT you can also get the regular flowers which really kills the chance of getting event flowers, so I would really like it if the developers changed the chance of getting event flowers or just didn't run events like this again in the future. Other than that I highly recommend this game!!"

So I deinstalled it, now I want to give it a second chance. As all my progress and achivevments are saved on my google play account I thought it would be easy just to recover my account, but is says that there are no accounts when I selected recover account. Very disappointed and upset as I would have to have to start all over again. Please could someone help me with this problem..."
"September 11, 2019",1,vedant rattan, Though the game is amazing Events are impossible to complete. And this game is all about events. You can barely complete a set of butterflies and never perfect it in one go. And the same set never repeats. Aka you have to spend a lot.. really a lot just to complete 1 set of butterflies.

And the same set never repeats. Aka you have to spend a lot.. really a lot just to complete 1 set of butterflies. And spoiler alert there are way to many..
"September 9, 2019",5,Jessica Dente," The game is beautiful and fun to play. I prefer it to Flutter: Starlight, as it's easier to level up and feels less frustrating. I wish it were easier to make game friends without using Facebook contacts. However, the events are well thought-out and the design is so pretty."
"September 15, 2019",5,Jessie, Great little game! Lots to do lots to collect. The butterflys are beautiful. I love that it actually teaches also. Not just a fun game you can learn from it to.
"November 8, 2019",5,Julie M.," I absolutely love the real butterflies, but they're all the better because they're so adorably rendered!"
"August 26, 2019",2,MozarteanChaos," an alright game, but you need a facebook account to save your progress. i lost all my progress when changing to a new phone, but i wouldnt use facebook if my life depended on it. needs a way to attach to google play account"
"October 26, 2019",4,Angie Polman, Normally love my butterflies but the last update messed things up. Everytime I hatch the last egg or try to check the butterflies it says something has gone wrong and starts that game over Help please
"September 22, 2019",5,Sonja Bradshaw, I like the game. The only thing I wish would change is the amount it takes to open the next section. Way too long to aquire enough to expand sanctuary.
"October 26, 2019",2,Orlando Anguiano, I wish this game was more like Starlight with frequent frog treats and slightly easier leveling up. This game is super cute but loses momentum relatively fast.
"November 8, 2019",3,irene johnson, Some missions not clear enough and too slow and expensive to clear an area.
"September 29, 2019",5,Angel VII, A nice relaxing game for collecting and raising various species of butterflies. Play for as much or little time as you want at a time.
"October 24, 2019",5,Phoebe Bates," Such a relaxing game to play in my spare time, never bored of it, love the music too. :)"
"August 27, 2019",4,Kodi Cakes, I love starlight and flutter but the only thing I request is you make the games idk compatable with Google cause I lost all my progress because i do not have Facebook. You could say make a Facebook account but I dont want or need one. If you could do that that would be amazing.
"October 11, 2019",5,Strawberry Racie, The pattern of raising butterflies and leveling up each one of them is so calming. Been playing this game for years.
"October 24, 2019",5,Audrey Maxine, Awesome game for passing time. Love the bright colours an background music.
"September 18, 2019",2,Anna Shim, Can not play unless I am on wifi. Support has not helped me. I was not asking to play offline just without wifi.
"August 26, 2019",5,Christy Cridlebaugh, It's relaxing. Has wonderful music and background sounds. I'm learning a lot about where they come from and the special way they act. I.e.- one partners up with ants and aphids.
"November 7, 2019",2,Sally -, My internet is okay but why it's still can't let me play this game...i don't have connections problems 😞😞
"September 26, 2019",5,Savannah Kocharyan, Very soothing game. I've had it for years now and still love it.
"October 5, 2019",1,D B," Why does it only show ""There has been a problem with the game"" ?"
"November 7, 2019",1,Shaquille Ellison, There is something wrong with the app. I cant open it and im worried i wont be able to complete the event in time
"August 26, 2019",3,Jeanie hook, Not as good as flutter Starlight moths. Rarely ever get any firefly treats for flowers in this game. My flower box always seems empty.
"October 10, 2019",4,Naomi Chen, I like it but my device is very slow so I can only hatch one butterfly its cute but I need fixing on my device I'm using
"September 15, 2019",5,Mariam Hakam, Just perfect! I really appreciate the minds and hearts behind this gorgeous game!
"October 24, 2019",5,Aoi Mizuki Tsukino," I love this game, its relaxing and easy to play."
"September 26, 2019",4,Michelle Yourdon," it is relaxing , and neat to learn the names of the different butterflies. and where you can find them."
"September 19, 2019",1,Misty Treadway," You really need to make it to where you can get flowers, especially for the event, easier to get, as well as, flutter bucks."
"September 3, 2019",5,Internet Dragon, I love it but I WANTED A GAME AND I HAD TO DELETE IT can you please save games in the cloud
"October 2, 2019",5,Stefan Kirkpatrick, Rely fun and esay to play l reccemend it is ok for kids to play.
"September 29, 2019",5,Weroniko, This is the best peaceful game there is. Calming. Relaxing.

The waiting time for different things in this game either takes a few minutes or a lot of hours and its mostly hours so its not really fun that way since there isnt much to do in the game anyways except for waiting and collecting coins and expanding your space in the game for more butterflies that require more waiting, but i think the animations and graphics are well done."
"August 2, 2019",2,Anthoni Fortier," It's an okay game plagued by the usual aggressive monetization showing down the pace.

There are pollen which you use to level up your butterflies, but instead of waiting longer but paying less in game currency for bulk, you actually have to pay more and wait longer. You also can't run any of your own audio on the background. It is incredibly beautiful and I'm disappointed at it's flaws."

"August 26, 2019",2,Baillie Schwint, App shuts down for virtually any reason.

Hate that the log in our account has to be facebook. would like a Google log in. just won't make an account. Hate Facebook. aesthetically pleasing. the caterpillar faces are cute. wish all the special butterflies had useful special powers instead of some having special effect powers. put the game down and picked it up a few times, restarting each time never bothered me. only quit due to losing interest due to normal ADHD things. Nothing actually bad with the game."
"September 25, 2019",4,Nanci Ives," Beautiful, but can get frustrating."
"September 25, 2019",3,Blurple Butterfly, Would like a side game to earn some items. Maybe a match 3 or puzzle
"October 18, 2019",5,Adriana Van Leeuwen, Very calming and surprisingly educational.
"October 30, 2019",5,Erin Tucker, This game is really relaxing I think you should get it please for me you'll love it
"September 30, 2019",1,Regina Querimit, same old story...have to spend too much money to keep up. So i don't. More stars if more $$ friendly.
"July 30, 2019",5,Wendolyn Trozzo," Fun and calming. it's really a game of leveraging in-game resources, but its also beautiful. You can play for free, though i decided to pay a couple of times - which is very rare for me, and says how much i enjoy the game."
"August 28, 2019",5,T Graham, Love it!! Might be better than their moth game! You are able to progress with out $$ so yay!
"July 24, 2019",1,Soné Botha," I love the Starlight one and got far. With flutter I cant get passed upgrading a flower. When i click it as the bird suggest, it just hops back to arrows showing to the flower. Please fix this bug as i dont want to delete this game."
"September 29, 2019",5,Patience Blum, In love with how BEAUTIFUL this game is! I cannot get enough of this game! EVERYBODY! You should paly this game!
"July 19, 2019",3,Eli Winston, After playing both this and their other game Starlight I will have to say this one is the lesser or the two. not very addictive and the economy seems very unbalanced. lost interest quickly even during the events.
"August 6, 2019",5,Ciara Rhodes," i love this game so much. i played it as a kid and i've recently found it again and i can't stop playing. i love the art and concept of flutter, it's so pretty and fun :-)"
"September 7, 2019",5,Jenna Huff, Love this game because I'm learning about the night time butterflies an the different months that night forge for pollen
"June 20, 2019",5,star claws, This game has great graphics and the control's are really nice and all the colours are pleasing to the eye. Overall this is on of my favorite games.
"July 14, 2019",4,Artemis Richardson, so I love this game my only problem was when I had a butterfly that was fully leveled up and I stored it it just disappeared and then two others wouldn't fuse so a lot of time wasted and pollen for nothing but otherwise fabulous
"July 13, 2019",5,Kortney Rau, I've been playing this game since 2014 and I absolutely love not just this game but every single game that this game company has made. I strongly urge you to play this game if you love a leisurely paced game 😁💖

"June 29, 2019",4,Paulius Dautoras, i love this game but now it says your sactuary doesnt load if your connected to the internet contact the support cast so here i am. it would be a 5 star but becouse this a 4 star

"September 23, 2019",4,I eat turtle soup with a plastic straw," Its really hard to get new butterflies, I thought flowers would spawn more commonly because its daylight but the irony is that its more easier to get more flowers in Starlight. It not that this game is bad, I just wish I didnt have to go to the shop more often than I usually do for flowers."
"September 1, 2019",5,Jessica Hodges," This game is very cute, light and relaxing. The butterflies that live in my sanctuary are extremely adorable therefore making this game very addictive. There is no end to this game and it never gets boring. The sanctuary is also really cute and cosy."

Ads don't pop right at your face. Collecting different types of butterflies and knowing real life facts about them is pretty cool. Kinda time-consuming, but it's fine for me. Just wondering why does it really need to be an online game. Maybe reconsider making it an offline-online game because there are cases where people are having long-term problems on Wi-Fi. Would often miss opportunities to get daily gifts and do more things in the sanctuary. But still, love it."

"July 7, 2019",2,Gábor Guthy," The graphics are beautiful, but the fact that the ""summoning circle"" produces RANDOM eggs each time makes the whole thing unpredictable. This game might be more enjoyable for others, but I think Splash: Ocean Sanctuary is way better."

I have more butterflies in storage than in the forest, but if I spend 6,500,000 honeydew you can have 1 extra butterfly each time. Crazy. I'm still working on getting an extra one. I deleted flutter after playing for ages I can't expand & nowhere to go."

Update: I've been playing since the beginning with a few months off now it seems that the admin that was around if we needed help are all gone. I think it is more of a child's game than it used to be, with the exception of a few oldies like myself and if you have a problem there's the standard ""contact support"", it feels like they just don't care any more, 3⭐, not 5"
"November 9, 2019",5,Angie Swan, Thank you for fixing this. I did notice it a few days ago and I logged in. I really like this game. I personally think you should create a new game with frogs in it too :)

made. Good stuff! I will always recommend this game to friends."

More butterflies to fillit and more flowers to buy."
"June 11, 2019",1,Naomi Saunders," I really love this game but the cost of flutter bucks is too high vs the cost to make some butterflies lay eggs.

I would spend more $ for bucks if the cost wasn't 175 for some to lay eggs. That's $6+ for ONE egg (on the more rare ones, but still) & it take FOUR eggs after the first discovery to max just ONE butterfly. Since I can't afford the $99 package, Im looking at $24+ EACH on the nicer butterflies to fuse them out to max. Cant do it. That's my only complaint. Would rate 5 stars otherwise."

I love the facts that came with each new completed butterfly. Events that were timely and challenging. I perfected many sets and events. Unfortunately I had to drop the game a year or so ago due to no longer having any room for butterflies. I have a fully expanded forest and no room to put any more. I was saddened by the fact I couldn't play to full capacity anymore and was hoping there would be an expansion update but its been over a year and there hasn't been. Still, its a nice game that's engaging and great to pass time and a brilliant way to calm down"

every time I touch a butterfly to gather honeydew. I can't see a setting to 
switch this to a long press, for example. Also, and perhaps this is me 
playing the game wrong, when I touch a flower or caterpillar to see how 
long to wait for it to finish its process, it would be nice to just see the 
remaining time pop up instead of all the extra detail."

Although, I find Starlight slightly better since it costs so much to expand 
your forest and I often find myself stuck where my storage and the forest 
is full so I'm stuck until I expand. I like the concept of butterflies 
having special abilities when they reach max level though, certainly makes 
the game easier and fixes the money problem. I like how there's an event 
every month for Flutter, Starlight and Splash. If you have all 3, there's 
basically always an event happening! Furistas Cat Café is pretty good 
considering its technically still in Alpha/Beta. Keep up the great work!"

sit and play a few hours or walk away without being penalized."
"July 25, 2018",5,Caitlin Peaty," Super cute and educational. It's relaxing too, and sometimes I'll just 
leave my screen on for a while to watch my butterlies flutter around."
"July 26, 2018",5,Bella Kilgore, For those seeking peace and beauty. I have anxiety and this game helps.

"July 13, 2018",4,Erin Lambert," Good way to spend free time. Whether you have time to check it only for 2 
minutes or sit there for thirty. This and the moth one are very relaxing to 
just sit and watch them all fly around and listen to the music."
"July 14, 2018",3,Katie Walker," Will give 5 stars when more butterflies are available. Also would like more 
decorations and maybe even the possibility of just buying them outright. 
Could use mini games as well but it really needs more butterflies and 
decorations!"

eggs, it keeps saying a file is lost and I end up in an endless cycle of 
reloading the game. Please fix!"
"July 11, 2018",4,Ben Gorman," It's a fantastic game but it gets to expensive to fast so you can't have 
new butterflies because it goes from paying 25to 500on the some leaf to 
expand"
"September 11, 2018",3,Kendra Montgomery, I love butterflies. You can learn the different names. How ever it is kind of slow and will take a long time to play.

sanctuary. This is perhaps a higher calling than any religion or 
organization."

theres something else to do."
"June 25, 2018",1,Julie W, The game was fun until the update. Now it says I don't have compatible device. I have a one year old kindle. I tried several times  to get it to works but no luck. So far starlight works fine....
"June 26, 2018",4,Ashley Rodeheffer," Good game, but, the events are super frustrating. I get you need a little 
challenge and initiative to gather all the wisps needed. However, it's 
impossible to collect enough wisps to complete ANY set. Fix that and 5 
stars."
"June 26, 2018",5,A Google user," I love the butterflies, but trying to select anything is a nightmare. 
Everything is in the way. Maybe when you tap on a butterfly, you'll grab 
it. Maybe you won't. Maybe you'll scroll. Maybe you'll waste money."

you made this app. I am also leaning about butterflies and the rest of the 
things in the app, that I never knew about. Again thank you for making this 
app. I have told two people about this app."
"May 15, 2018",5,Effie Rogers," I love it!! I haven't put it down since I downloaded it. My only hiccup 
with it is I don't get enough flutterbucks, but that is literally the only 
downfall I've seen but it doesn't affect thebsame that much, just help 
speed some things up."
"April 27, 2018",3,Johanna Long," Was a really good game but for a while now I have been unable to watch the 
snail videos. App just closes down. When will this be fixed? Also I've been 
playing for some time now, so have expanded as far as I can but I keep 
earning honeydew and there's nothing to do with it!"

"May 12, 2018",5,Tracy Call," Love everything about this game. Beautiful, soothing and educational. 
Achieving goals reveals new challenges and gorgeous creatures. The snail is 
great as you can get honeydew to open more areas by watching videos. Fun 
and lovely game."
"May 4, 2018",5,xXshadowXx2004 -," I really love this game, it is claming, relaxing and It dosnt get boring,

this game is one of a kind and includes thoughtful moments. Also, it is a 
mindful relaxation game so that you get some rest. The soothing music is 
amazing and plus, it helps you learn about butterflies and see the 
evolution of butterfly form. The cute incects are each one of a kind and 
they are almost right-looking! Get me? This game is one best and I rate it 
5 stars 100 % goodly and today is my baby sis' bday so I am happy to be 
playing a nice game, that is really bright. I think everybody has to have 
this game, play it with happiness, and think that this game is a nice one. 
Also, I wanted some updates. Anyways, this game is perfect. Thanks!"

butterflies. Where's the fun in that?"

My one complaint is that I have so much useless honeydew, there should be a way to turn honeydew into flutterbucks, or something else to spend it on other than expansions. I also love organising so if there was a way to have different areas to store different Butterflies, for example into thier abilities, then this feature would be really welcomed! Thank you for a beautiful relaxing game ♥️"
"April 14, 2018",5,Daphnee Richardson," Wonderful, beautiful and just a great way to spend time. What another 
awesome thing about this game, would be is if there were a few more ways to 
earn more flutter bucks, the same way they have groovy events. Just for 
flutter bucks once or twice a month, without having to buy Doug the glow 
bug."
"March 16, 2018",5,Rebecca Howard, I've been playing this game for a while on and off and I always find myself coming back to it. Its cute and charming. I love perfecting the butterflies and the diversity of the species. I had a problem with my pollen flowers not upgrading but the support team is great and quickly fixed it for me!
"April 11, 2018",5,Jackie Lascelles, I messaged 3 weeks ago about the video snail not working. I rely on watching videos to get flutter bucks and honey. This is a great game but I will have to uninstall it if I can't watch the video snail to help me earn things 😔
"April 16, 2018",3,CJ Clearwater," I like this game but not as much as the Flutter Moth one. There is less to do and just less interesting somehow. Also, the snail is glitchy. Everytime I try to watch a free video for stuff it crashes the game."
"April 11, 2018",5,Paula Williams," I love Flutter,  but Flutter Starlight is my favorite! I play both back and forth and can't get enough of them. I hope that one day that they will bring out one with moths and butterflies together!!!"

butterfly which makes me exited and makes it worth the wait.😍 I also love 
the Event's too. I don't know how to tell you guys and gals how grateful I

"February 24, 2018",3,Double Diamond, It's getting boring and boring. Maybe you guys could think of ways on improving the game. The events are also tiring because it is the same all over. I like the game but come on I'm so bored with it. Sorry. But i think this is my last event.

But that particular species never returned even though you have this 'butterflies from past events visiting' many times before. I just want to complete the collection this time.

Same events, same extremely expensive in game purchases (both cash and free methods). Would be nice to see a new form of event in the future, or a new feature. It's still something I pull out when I'm bored but it's certainly no longer something that keeps me playing for hours every day like I used to. Shame. As it's a beautiful game, well made and functions well. It would just be nice to see something a bit different to add a bit of life to it again. Personally I'd love to be able to cross breed butterflies (obviously that doesn't fit in with the scientifically accurate theme of the game) but just something new, to spark my interest again. Or being able to sell butterflies for flutter bucks as well as gold to make expansion more manageable, allowing players to more easily collect every butterfly. I hate games that satisfy the urge to collect. Then make it near impossible to actually KEEP the things you've earned. In this case all the butterflies."
"March 4, 2018",4,Raina Rutabaga," It's a nice and relaxing game. I get a little frustrated with how much clearing spaces can cost, but overall it's a peaceful and pretty game."

"February 26, 2018",5,Rachel Marriott, I love the diversity of the different types of butterflies. The graphics are decent but could be improved. But so far this game is very fun the play.
"March 9, 2018",5,Joyfull_Dayz, This game is SO cool because it has most of the butterflies I've seen like the dotted boarder!

And the butterflies are of varieties of bright colors. I am playing this wonderful game since a year and have more than 30 species of beautiful butterflies. The game never makes me bore and the daily discounts and rewards are just ausome. As i am increasing their levels i am discovering new abilities of them. Just in love with the app. Don't miss to try it Please
"March 15, 2018",5,Natalie Farley," I love it,but everything freezes and it wont save so i have to redo things."
"March 1, 2018",5,fatima nisar," This is a quiet interesting game, with so much to learn about the butterfly species but you cannot collect them all."

"January 28, 2018",1,Michelle Hebert, This game crashes constantly. You play get all your stats up come back the next day and all your progress has been deleted. There are no mini games or anything it's just collecting stuff so why is it crashing? I like butterflies but can't deal with the loss of all my progress everyday sorry.
"February 3, 2018",2,A Google user," I really enjoyed this game. However,  I can't continue to play if I have to keep starting from the beginning every time.  This game doesn't keep your progress. I'm too frustrated to continue playing at this point."
"January 15, 2018",1,Beatriz Barreto," And it happened again. 2days ago I've updated the app and it was working perfectly, today it downloaded a few new things and it crashed and it won't start again. I don't know how many times this happened already. I give up, am going to delete it. Good luck."
"February 9, 2018",4,L Sward," I've been playing this game on and off again for a few years, one of my absolute favorite games. The only problem I always have are the videos, always seems to be a bug that causes them to pause or freeze."

It's on a timer and the icon for it is in the upper right corner. The last one I was able to figure out but the current one (appears to be 2 feathers) I have no idea what it's for and would like to take advantage of whatever bonus it offers before it disappears. I've searched the help manual and gone on Google but no info. I noticed when I first got the reward there was a pop up that said what it was but it was too small and disappeared too quickly for me to read it.
"February 9, 2018",3,Vladimir Marinov," Good game, looks like lot of passion was put into the graphics. Bit repetitive and boring. Unfortunately my phone overheats with this game, doesn't overheat on any other game."
"February 6, 2018",5,Bradley Thompson," Oh flutter after mino monsters 2, mino monsters and food battle the game died out and the sandbox fell through with ads crashes and bugs you are the only game from my childhood that I actually liked that hasn't been torn to shreds thank you."

My main point of criticism is that the game does not provide a lot of information. For example regarding the new event: It was written nowhere in the game, that the flowers collected would vanish after the event. I went to check out the Facebook page a couple of hours before the end of the event and found this out, much to my dismay. Over the whole event I had collected lots and lots of flowers, but was busy with growing other butterflies, which is why I delayed attracting event butterflies til after the event. Now it is apparent, that I will not achieve my goal, due to the flowers vanishing. It would have been very nice to have had this info when starting the event. Otherwise I believe Flutter to be a very enjoyable game, especially since it doesn't demand constant attention.  It is also quite informative, the butterflies you can gain have nicely made info pages, that tell a bit about their real life counterparts."
"January 11, 2018",4,mona lisa," I really love this game. But, the one problem I have, is that it won't load when I'm connected to wifi. I have to turn it off and use my mobile data, to play it. I don't want to keep using my mobile data. Please fix this issue."

Sometimes I can't get into the game, and often when I do get in, it keeps saying there was a log in issue and it won't save any of the changes I made to the game. The same goes for Flutter: Starlight, and if I have to leave this review on both games to get my point across, I will. Get your games in line, Runaway"
"December 23, 2017",3,Charlize Stratton," I think it's a great game and I love how adorable the caterpillars are and beautiful the butterflies are, however, I hate the fact that it cost so much honeydew to expand my little sanctuary. And then I can't hatch any more butterflies because I can't expand the sanctuary. It gets really annoying."
"December 29, 2017",2,miramichi 75, Game was good but now its glitchy. Eggs are taking 4 days to hatch...the countdown showed days hours and mins ...pretty hard to compete in the events  Can't collect from butterflies. They have had a 4 day timer..

It is so very relaxing, the music just eases tension immediately.  It has enough activities to keep it fun and interesting, at a nice slow, easy, enjoyable pace.  You can play without purchase but you will want to spend on this one.  The butterflies are so gorgeous and the animation is really great.  Not some corny click game, you can tell an artist put a lot of time into this game, one who is a definite butterfly enthusiast.  One of the most motivating parts of gameplay is getting prizes often through accomplishments.   I really like how generous they are.  It let's you experience more of the game so you can decide where to spend your money if you choose to pay to play.   I don't usually take the time to review but I did the first time this game asked me to, which was after about 7 days of game play!!!  Not every 7 seconds like some games.  Highly recommend.   To the dev's: thank you and great job!  Only one critique: I wish there was a confirmation button, like ""are you sure?"" and then ""yes"" or ""no"" buttons for the larger purchases in game.   My 4 yo son came over and started pointing to the wisp mother and he touched the screen bringing up the rush option and he touched the screen again and spent 25 of my hard earned Flutterbucks with 2 fast clicks.  Was so bummed.  He was totally thrilled though and loved catching the cute little wisp babies so that was worth it.  But with that and the pollen (be careful when you scroll if your screen is very sensitive as you can easily select an option you didn't mean to!) It would be really nice to have a chance to say ""oops"".  :)  Those things are not a big deal though and take away no stars!   5/5 all the way.  Classy, fun, relaxing.  Love it."

What isn't so nice is when you make a purchase and what you purchased disappears. I bought a glowbug for the daily flutterbucks, closed and opened the game again a few minutes later and found that Doug had disappeared. He is not in my storage, he is not in my forest. What a waste of money."
"December 20, 2017",5,Linnea Weilacher," Interesting. I love butterflies. I used to catch them, let them go in my room and watch them fly all over my room.  This game is fascinating because I get to learn about different species of butterflies."
"December 18, 2017",5,Destiny Nieves," This game is amazing! I absolutely love it! I am a huge animal lover and I love all three of Runaway's games- from being peaceful to educational, their games are just wonderfully made. (Also, I had an idea: could you guys make a bird aviary one? I think that would be a great idea.) 😊"
"December 16, 2017",5,A Google user," I love this game, it makes me feel like a mom!!! Me; hatching, raising, and caring my baby butterflies!!! I play this everyday, although i must admit: the Florida tree snail is pretty annoying sometimes!!!"
"December 22, 2017",4,Aida Azani, i don't know why but it keeps logging in back while i was playing saying it was connection error whereas my internet connection is so good. it stressed me out as i was playing the game. please fix this
"December 22, 2017",3,Laraine Kuhn, I hate having to constantly redo things. I've re-cleared the same patch of leaves 5 times now. And I loose whatever other progress I have going as well. I've lost butterflies that I've hatched and progressed to adults multiple times because of this issue.
"December 17, 2017",3,Satria Arinto, I don't know why but I can't upgrade the blue flower to produce more pollen it's stuck at lvl 1
"December 22, 2017",5,AlphaFox64, Best and most relaxing game on the app store I highly recommend this and flutter starlight! But the underwater game would be much better if they just let you keep the fish just like in flutter.

All in all it's very beautiful and very relaxing.  And the support team is very good! Thanks!

Or info about ANY INFORMATION pertaining to personal calls on my phone? Its invasive and I just deleted your app because of it, as much as I really liked the app. Y'all need to check your boundaries"
"November 25, 2017",3,Justin Hinz," Fun game. But, there comes a point where you have nothing to do but wait. There isn't motivation to keep the app open. I'm happy to have contributed to your game. Not sure what suggestions to make."

"October 25, 2017",4,Diana Reid," Love this game, very relaxing. I do buy some of the stuff, very disappointed in some of the events that take place. If you go on often and receive so many wisps during an event, it seems like they penalize you by limiting the amount of wisps you can catch"
"October 15, 2017",4,Krystina Steigerwald," It's not as good as Starlight, but it's still pretty good. Only complaint is that it's harder to get enough coins and butterflies. I got both apps at the same time and I have more moths than butterflies."

"November 3, 2017",4,Neha Hanna, I really like it but as much as I like it It has some freezing issues and also I sometimes try 5 or 6 times before sucessfully play a video that's why I did not give this awesome game 5/5

"September 18, 2017",5,Princes AV, This game is the best!! It's addictive and a great time passer. Its also very relaxing.  I can come home from a stressful day at school and play this game relax. I also like the idea that you can watch ads for dewdrops (I think types what they are). And the graphics are so beautiful and cute!😍😻
"September 4, 2017",4,Kerry fryer," Won't open at all on my S8, shame seems a really nice game to play on my tablet bit want it for my phone. EDIT 04/09 : it is now working on my phone and I love it! My only bad thing to say is it takes to long to earn honeydew to clear patches because that gets expensive very quickly 😕."

"September 27, 2017",3,Ashley Davison," The flutterbucks are too expensive to utilize. It's a cute game, but I can't justify spending money here and there to push myself further along. Make them stretch further and I'd give this game 5 stars."
"September 2, 2017",5,Rhii-ane, Its great! But mine won' t open whenever I try to start it. Although even with the bugs or glitches its still a great game with relaxing music and a lot of activities to do.

"September 7, 2017",5,Jennifer Nasario, Graphics are really good. Funny little bark bugs and leaf bugs pop up in random places to find. I just think its a nice game. For someone who likes peaceful slow paced game.
"October 3, 2017",2,Emma Charlett-Green," Sadly enough, the videos you can watch for a reward often don't work properly, often resulting in having to watch three entire videos to get just one reward finally for it. Please fix this, everything else is so wonderful it's sad it kinda ruins it"

"September 28, 2017",5,A Google user, Great game  Addictive Really awesome for time pass Best thing is that we learn about different species and many more.. Just loved it I recommend it to others too...
"September 18, 2017",5,Udonia Price, I just started playing and I love it already. It has such a variety of butterflies and it's also educating me about the different species. Would love if they did a game for other critters like spiders.
"September 4, 2017",1,Swarnendu Das, This is a very good game until it pops up notification saying upgrade flower but every time I press on upgrade button nothing happens and it stays same and the notification is not going away which is quite annoying.
"September 15, 2017",4,Jade Eagle, Beautiful and wonderful. It's addicting and relaxing. I would like to have a better understanding on how to attract the butterflies I want (perhaps a section in the menu to explain better). Also being able to zoom in on the encyclopedia would be nice.

If this bug was fixed, I would definitely rate the game five stars."
"July 7, 2017",5,Erica Jones," I love the game. Takes time to really start up a butterfly forest. But I think its worth it.

I don't know if this is really how it is in real life. Not invluding the toad, owl, and other creatures of course. But who knows maybe certain butterflies are attracted to certain flowers. And I know I've definitely seen funny looking and different mesmerizing colored, sized, and shaped caterpillars and butterflies in real life."
"July 10, 2017",1,Amy Kinz," I loved this game for the longest time, but for whatever reason I can no longer open it. It freezes on the very first scene."
"July 17, 2017",4,Bulbasaur Madness, Its a really fun game and very addictive but one thing I really wish you improve on is reducing the hatch time for all the butterflies. If it wasn't for that this would have been a 5 star
"July 7, 2017",1,Tasha Willis, Waste of time! At first it was fun and pretty graphics. It now glitches every single time I open the game. DELETING IT!
"July 2, 2017",5,Nyssa Adams, A very dangerous game.  I used to have friends and hobbies. Now all I do is raise butterflies. Ten out of ten would flip-flap again.
"July 24, 2017",2,Keri Coldiron, The snail won't play videos so I can't earn flutterbucks so what's the point now? I'VE already spent money and each time the game crashed so I had to contact support to get what I paid for. There are glitches that need to be fixed so I'm not rating any higher.
"July 15, 2017",1,Princess Yong," In the middle of an event, all a sudden, Flutter is unable to open now, I just want to complete the butterflies set before the event end."

"July 13, 2017",3,Oliver Griffin, The graphics got messed up and it's confusing and quite unplayable.
"July 18, 2017",3,Maimoona Khan, What is wrong with the game???? As soon as it starts there is this loading sigb on screen and it is just stuck qt that state :-/

I really want to give it five stars, but it needs a few things. First, there are a few too many glitches on the free videos. I am already owed like ten Flutter bucks but didn't get them after watching video ads. Second, frog treats should appear more often. Notice that in starlight, you made that happen, so kudos on that. Last, make it a little easier to get epic and legendary flowers. I really want to collect as many butterflies as possible, that would really help. Oh and one more thing-- it would be awesome if we could visit our friends' forests...I know that may take some development changes, but it would truly take the game above and beyond. Thanks for a lovely game!!"
"May 30, 2017",2,Lauren Gerber, The graphics are great but the gameplay is horrible.  Every 5 minutes or less it glitches out and won't let you touch anything.  You have to completely exit the app and force stop to go back in before you can do anything but zoom around in a random fashion.
"June 13, 2017",5,Dawn evans," I had played once before and was thrilled to find it again! So nice. Not only entertaining and fun but you learn so much without even realizing it. Five stars, two thumbs up all those goods reviews. Thank you flutter."
"May 31, 2017",5,laattardo, Problem with this update! My game resizes on its own now. Gets bigger and bigger every time I touch the screen. Then it maxes out how big it can get and won't go back to being small!

The flower events suck. They're the worst type of event. Events are already hard enough to do, but the flowers spawn so rarely that I only have one butterfly out of four unlocked ones in this current event, with just seven days to go. When I looked at reviews during the time of the last flower event, this page was flooded with complaints about it. I wasn't the only one who was upset about it, and I'm sure I'm not the only one still having trouble with these events. Please fix this."
"June 5, 2017",5,Kirsti White," Like so many others reviewing here I too have same problem. My game zooms in so many times and nothing responds to my touch,have to exit all the time to restart. I don't want to delete the game as I'm pretty far along after just opening 2 new sets. Isn't an update supposed to improve the game?"
"May 30, 2017",5,Irina Mirosnicenko, The game is lovely. I am relaxing while playing.  But it does have lots of glitches. Like lots of times it restarts by itself and i am loosing my honeydew. Or from yesterday i cannot collect honeydew from my butterflies because they do not respond to touch. Could game team please fix the bugs.
"June 3, 2017",2,Naomi Hoard," Seems like it could be a fun game, but it keeps glitching. When I touch the screen it zooms in and out, won't let me collect anything or click on anything. Have to restart to get it working again, but glitch comes back after a minute."
"June 8, 2017",3,Steph Kraner, I would give this game five stars if the controls didn't constantly freeze up and cause me to have to restart. Great game though. Shame I'll probably get annoyed with the constant freezing an uninstall it.
"June 8, 2017",5,Djj Aniket, Thnx for a very beautiful game like this... i love it tooo much... but i have a problem... please reduce the amount of honey seeds for open new store.. i think you understand what am i say... sorry i'm little poor in english... 😶

After I hv spent real MONEY... the events are more difficult to complete... the same eggs are only available for months now... the only major way to progress is buy bucks & or lay eggs or buy attract flowers... the zoom is out in BOTH games & the time in all three gets beyond what normal... I was very satisfied learning about the butterflies moths & see animals But now it's more frustration than pleasure & money spent

"June 11, 2017",5,Meagan Ligon," Very cute, and has little things to do if you want to sit peacefully and watch it. It also quickly gets to the point where if you prefer, you can just check on it periodically. It does occasionally have difficulty loading, but usually force closing and reopening works."
"June 11, 2017",3,Helen Mitchell, I love this game but I really don't love the fact it takes so long to load regularly crashes and is so glitchy.  It never used to be like this.  Runway please fix it because you are adding more and more features and it's trashing performance big time.
"June 6, 2017",4,Cori Green, overall great but there are some bugs that need to be fixed. Every so often when I load the game the graphics only half load and I have to shut it down or uninstall to fix it

"June 8, 2017",3,Stefanie Vasquez," Would have loved to give more stars, but it kept getting stuck in zoom mode without me even trying to zoom in or out in the first place. I have to keep restarting the game. If this isn't fixed soon, I'll be deleting game."

"June 13, 2017",3,laura witt, Love this game but the events are hard to complete because they won't drop enough flowers. Tired of coming up short.
"June 11, 2017",3,EvenNote Emerald," If only they'd fix the ""video"" snail, which is supposed to let you watch videos to earn small rewards. Unfortunately it hasn't worked properly in months. And the ""videos"" are often game demos or web pages that don't give the promised rewards and/or crash the game."
"June 3, 2017",3,Aubrey Donohew, Getting the same glitches as everyone else where the screen zooms in everytime you touch it and you cant do anything except zoom and you have to exit the app and restart it to get it to work right

"June 20, 2017",2,Stephanie Bowen," The bugs I was experiencing have been fixed, so i can actually enjoy the game now :) I think I prefer Starlight a little more though -- the flowers and fireflies seem very few and far between in comparison. Still a fun game though!"
"June 6, 2017",2,RMary Vu, Graphics and gameplay is great but glitches like no tomorrow! Cant touch anything besides zooming in and out. Very dissappointed.

Still good game but totally crashes about half the time whenever I use the snail and I think that there are times when I supposedly collect things, they don't appear. It didn't use to do that. Gone from relaxing to frustrating."
"May 27, 2017",5,Nicole Dougherty, I love this game but have trouble with the graphics messing up all the time. I have to restart my phone to fix it and that gets old fast.
"May 16, 2017",5,Victoria James," I didn't think I'd follow through with this game. But I'm addicted, I've learned SO much about butterflies, my forest is huge and beautiful and I'm so happy. I take care of my lil butterflies and I have fun making it bigger and better every day. What I really love is that they're real!"

They've required their players to prove by receipt that they paid for things (don't they have records?!) and locked the players out of their game while they do this, keeping them from collecting their paid currency from the daily currency item they paid real money to get. And for using features they included in another game (Splash), they reset that player's premium currency to 0!!  I'm still playing because I still like the GAME, but every time I am tempted to spend money, I rethink it. I've spent a tiny bit of money here or there for special events, but I've stopped spending the amount I used to. It may dwindle to NOTHING after what they've been doing to their players. (Edit: And dear god why does it take SO LONG to load this game?! I'm on a Pixel C, and it takes so long I get a 'stopped responding' message TWICE before it finishes loading!)"
"May 29, 2017",4,The Pledger Family, This is a great relaxing game but I also play The moth sanctuary and that is a much better game. This one lacks the fun of the moth one. Better level up and better game play. Hope this one will catch up to the moth sanctuary.
"May 16, 2017",5,Snailloverem, Since the new update to drop mobage accounts i havent played due to being inable to restore my old game data. I had played for a very long time and collected lots of event butterflies but now i would have to start over :/
"April 29, 2017",3,Brenda campisi, I loved this game until I got Nougat.. now it won't even open. It's a shame.
"May 5, 2017",4,Jennifer Horsley," I used to love this game, but I have used all of my expansions, and now it's too hard to play the events. Storage is hard to build and besides, I would like to display my butterflies. Will there be another expansion of the Sanctuary any time soon?"

"May 17, 2017",5,A Google user, The graphics are amazing & I'm endlessly impressed by how accurately realistic the species are. I have become very attached to all of my fluttery little friends. Love that it's stress free & also quite addictive.
"May 19, 2017",3,Donna Richen, Love the game but I would love it more if you could send eggs of butterflies you already have to other players. I know I would like more event butterflies but some that come in just isn't the one I want.
"May 7, 2017",5,kaine poxon, The only problem I have with the game is the time for the caterpillars to hatch and to feed them If you could make it a bit quicker I would love the game

In the early stages its difficult to expand your forest. The forest lay out is a bit strange as well and as there is an event going right now obtaining event flowers is quite difficult compared to the sona event that just happened in Flutter: Starlight where getting event flowers felt more balanced. I feel liked comparing the two Flutter: Starlight wins hands down.
"April 9, 2017",4,Sirius Appicello," Love the entire concept of the game. I do wish expansions didn't cost so much honeydew, and that the flowers would pop up more often. Also, have been playing for three days and my log in the achievements only shows one."
"March 29, 2017",4,Cristina Niculescu," It has a bit for everyone, i would say. Cute little creatures, beautiful butterfly, a big collection that is ever growing and a tad of social competition. It's a good game and it could be a fantastic way to relax. Only depends on what you expect from the forest and your collection of flutters ;)"
"April 24, 2017",1,Fable Thump," Same problem as everyone else. Since Halloween update, game won't load and gets stuck. My friends that it did work for are already collecting butterflies for the event. Most are not cause they can't load the game either. Low stars till fixed."

"April 14, 2017",2,A Google user, I don't know how to feel about this game anymore. I like it but people in my group have been accused of cheating when they haven't used illegal copies of the game or hacked it. Makes me wonder who is next.

It has been virtually impossible to get enough flowers to create the event butterflies and we are halfway. Also I haven't received gifts for completing the mile stones. Really frustrating! and don't get me started on the cost of space. Please could you make a find friend option that doesn't involved facebook. Thank you"
"May 1, 2017",5,Sammie Marie," I usually go through apps like crazy, keep them for a few weeks then delete them because I get bored. I've had this app almost a year, and I love my butterflies. I have the moths too."
"April 21, 2017",1,Tamara Cox," Don't waste money on any flutterbucks. Runaway will take your flutter bucks and refuse to give you a refund. Even if you provide a legit explanation of your purchases, they will take your in game currency and refuse to give them back or give you a refund."
"March 28, 2017",5,Rheanna Steel," Very relaxing game. I was trying to find something less competitive to play in my spare time, one where I didn't have to rely on a guild/alliance etc and where I could go at my own pace. Tired of always feeling pressured when I play games. This fit the bill perfectly!"
"April 8, 2017",3,Kitzian Calliss, The event flowers on the branches are ridiculous. They never appear. I will probably not complete the set despite checking my forest frequently as I refuse to buy your insanely expensive flutterbucks.
"April 9, 2017",3,Arachne345," I love this app! Would love to see a version with birds, frogs or cats! 😍 edit: events where the flowers appear on the tree are the worst and impossible to finish without spending a lot of real money. I'd like to see only whisp events in the future."

Flutter the flowers are hard to come by so are fireflies which means the game is at a stand still for a long long time! Constantly hitting a wall for days on end in game play before you can move forward were all you can do is collecte coins front your butterflies. Flowers spawn rarely lighting bugs are rare and no matter the missions or what I'm doing that does not change flower spawning or lighting bugs. I love Starlight and Splash. If flowers and lighting bugs would show up more I give a much better rating. Right now the current event is a joke because flowers never show up for it.
"April 24, 2017",5,Angel Picard," ADDICTED!! I can't stop playing! The sister game, Starlight, is just as awesome! I was confused trying to figure out how to do missions the first time but everything else is pretty easy."
"April 15, 2017",5,gaarabae, This game is my favourite thing in a long time so far I have over 15 butterflies in about 2 weeks! You don't have to spend money if you can't or don't want to but so far i have only spent 89p on this game and I'm still not bored. I recommend this game to anyone and everyone!
"March 31, 2017",3,jackie faulhaber, I can't see anything anymore. Can't see when you click on a b butterfly to use power. You can't see the butterflies only parts of them I can't tell where anything thing is. I can't tell what is what  only partial Anna demographics and this used to be my favorite game

"March 14, 2017",5,Victoria Davis, Love this! One thing though. The color contrast of the background can make it harder to see the smaller species. Controls are precise.
"March 29, 2017",5,Shaye K, Very cute game and pretty graphics. It's fun casual game and the music and sounds are actually fairly relaxing. Neat to learn facts about your butterflies as you lever them up.
"March 19, 2017",2,Donna Lombardo," Having trouble with it for about 48 hours now. The butterflies, bird, and frog are now boxy and difficult to identify. The menu are nearly unusable. Have uninstalled and reinstalled twice, which fixes it until the next time I open it, then out goes back to deformed graphics."

They also changed some butterfly abilities so now you have to recruit more friends to play for it to be useful.

You had them available for purchase for 2 days, then back to this. There are events often, but as far as daily play, it's very boring. If not updated soon, I'll have to delete."
"February 5, 2017",3,Svitlana Chamina," I love this game, but unfortunately on the current event I don't get the gifts for the milestones passed in giving out the presents :'( And I saw that already two milestones have been reached! It is really upsetting!"
"February 7, 2017",5,Tina Policińska," Love the graphics, relaxing music and the fact there's no competing with other players. Every butterfly has a unique ability and they all can be found in the real world. Also - customer service was nothing helpful to me."

"February 20, 2017",3,Karen P, Not allowing it to connect to facebook basically makes it useless why if you want to be so facebook pally is this not just a Facebook game ? I cannot even log it in to my Google play account! ! Sorry will be uninstalling as I will not play just to have guest account wiped at first problem.
"February 22, 2017",4,Gayatri Mehr," I love the game, but whenever I try to exit it, it just doesn't exit? It just goes back to the game! Then when I close it by minimizing it and then go back to it, all my progress of that session is gone! What the hell?"

"February 10, 2017",5,Candice Peoples," So far I enjoy this game. Its a slow learning process for me. Its a little hard to understand, support is good though. It kind of gives you hints on the game. I will keep playing for sure!"
"January 3, 2017",1,Whitney Harris,These updates are killing me! Before everything was enlarged and overlapping and I was able to temporarily fix the issue by restarting my phone. Now I'm having the issue of extremely pixelated graphics. These recent updates are horrible and truly ruining an enjoyable gaming experience.

"February 20, 2017",3,Lux," It was fine when I first download it, but this morning, the morning after I downloaded it, all the butterflies looked like blocks, and the cocoon did to, and everything else was messed up. I tried reloading but that did absolutely nothing. The other game that you made, the moth one, is better."

I lived it.. been playing it for about an hour now.. but I backed out to go make dinner and opened up the app again and all my stuff is zoomed in. Not the view but the flowers, leaves, and butterfly are huge on the same size scale.. like THEY themselves got bigger and now are clustered together. Also, all the butterflies look like they have square wings and glitch the heck out of the game, I was looking at one in particular tried to interact with it and it just disappeared.. kinda.. the game glitch made it look like the wings dropped off its body. I'm a little upset cause these games are very relaxing to me. Hope this gets fixed. Kinda annoying."
"January 4, 2017",5,Mroczek Family,"The perfect game I love this game! It's relaxing, mildly educational, beautiful, fun and addictive!

"February 7, 2017",2,Rebecca Russell, This was a great game but the changes that they have made in recent months and the lack of respect for their players by the support team make it not so fun to play now.

"January 20, 2017",3,Carrie Talbot, Would give it 5 stars if the snail would work consistently. It was a good way to get flutter bucks without having to buy them all the time. Plus I enjoyed seeing the videos.
"January 18, 2017",1,Fiona Kalos,Zoom in After I reload the game everything is so zoomed in the only way to fix it is to uninstall and reinstall. Cant move butterflies as they r half there and no my phone isnt zoomed in

I've also been playing the new starlight moth game.  Each game is very different and I like how starlight is setup when it comes to buying flowers.  I've got butterflies that have been stuck as they are for years because I can't afford to buy the flowers to fuse them nor can I finish any sets because I keep getting the same damn flowers and they're also too expensive and not available for pollen.  I think flutter would be vastly better if some of the elements of starlight was implemented into flutter.  Some months I don't even touch flutter because I'm stuck and there's nothing for me to do other than click on the butterflies. Also there's got to be some way to find other people to play with. I don't know ANYONE on facebook that plays nor will I bug them to play with me.

Everything is now arranged like starlight and the number of flowers to buy in the shop using honey dew is now only 2 which im unhappy about. Their is one thing that if flutter team can make happen would be appreciated by me that none of my FB friends play this game and I have no one to exchange gifts with. So it would be nice if there is a way to exchange gifts with people who play flutter and not necessarily on Facebook.

"January 5, 2017",1,A Google user,"Stalls and crashes , freezes your phone up. Horrible Horrible! Ever since the newest update this game stalls,freezes,crashes. Then it freezes my phone up.

Every 2 hours on the dot I'd be notified but now I get nothing. When an even was starting, I'd be notified at the start. Now I don't get anything till it's nearly over!! Honestly this is letting the game down so badly, it needs fixing!!"

"August 19, 2016",4,The Peacekeeper," Puts ads all over my phone, my music app, Poweramp, detects all these sound files entitled ""320"" and it's location says flutter. This game probably has Spyware too, to watch if you're looking at them. Tip for you, showing ads at the start up screen instead."
"October 29, 2016",4,Luana Meyer,"Flutter Butterflies abilities will say, 10 barkbugs and I'll get maybe 2 or 4. And, it's not me not seeing them. What's up with that?? I used to get as many as it said. 😣"

( like Uzuri, Mariposa, etc.) And also more forest, cause I expanded all of it a long, long time ago."
"June 11, 2016",5,Zarabeth Conley,I love this game When the events happen I only get like two flowers I don't know what is happening but please fix it
"June 24, 2016",5,Janie Jody, Ive been a flutter fan for over 3 years! This is my all time favorite game.
"June 3, 2016",3,Green Fairy Graphics,Not bad Just wish expanding didn't cost so much...it is a little ridiculous. Tone that down and this would get a 5.
"June 6, 2016",2,Sanja Z,Bugs Ever since this latest update the game force closes on me after every minute! Please fix this! Gonna return to 5 stars after you do it.

Of course they are busy some times and their time is different than mine as well. But they do try their hardest to help players who are experiencing glitches or issues.

The graphics are good, but it gets boring. The challenges follow the same pattern. Butterflies with really helpful abilities are almost impossible to complete unless if you have nothing but time and money to throw away at digital purchases. Wish there was something to do in the game other than tap butterflies ... boring."
"March 22, 2016",5,Sabrina Sadecky,"Fantastic I really enjoy this app.  However after the latest samsung update it messed with the graphics and everything is all blockey now. Please have an update to make it compatible with the latest samsung update, I already miss looking at my beautiful butterflies."
"March 16, 2016",3,Jessie Waid,Love the game but It is now saying error loading updates and won't open the game :( last time this happened and I reinstalled I lost everything I just started playing again a couple weeks ago any suggestions?
"April 16, 2016",5,Mydnight Shaman,"Great Butterfly game! Played others, hated them. This one is not only fun but engaging and constantly keeps me coming back for more. Plus every creature is adorable!"

Other real life things happened and I wasn't able to play for weeks because the spare time I had was devoted to better games.  When I came back to this one and after a few downloads on the title screen updating the game it just restarted me and I lost all progress. After reading all the opinions from others I deleted right away. Too bad no one listened whoever they are
"April 12, 2016",5,Mary Tobar,Peace & Tranquility I enjoy the music in the background and the fact that i can be background to other things. I tend to listen to books and it plays even when i have the app open. The game is challenging yet managable. I highly recommend for people who like to play games daily but dislike over the top flashing games.
"April 16, 2016",4,Beth Randall Moorhead,Odd problem Marshmallow update makes the butterflies look boxy and funny. I have to restart my S6 Edge for it to work right.  Is there an update coming soon for that?
"May 14, 2016",3,Natalie Jones,"Love this game Love this game but the updates keep saying not enough storage and to delete other app, I'm not deleting anymore as these updates keep coming up and not going to keep deleting others off, when there's enough space there. Hope this gets resolved.  X"
"March 29, 2016",2,Jessica Field,App not working I love this game so much. Ive been playing this game for over a year. But with the new update my app will not load. I missed a whole event and I'm sad that i cant play right now.
"March 11, 2016",4,B Dark,"Great game This would be amazing if on the Kindle or something larger ,I love it but it's tiny and you don't get to enjoy the prettiness of the butterflies so much ."
"March 16, 2016",5,Jamiethiel S,Adorable The music isn't so invasive that it needs to be turned off.  One of the things you unlock as you level your butterfly is their scientific name. This is the best game app I've downloaded.

I haven't given 5 stars for 2 reasons, the main reason being that I no longer have any of my Google friends linked to the app and to have any Facebook friends I would need to add people I do not know as none of my actual friends play this, secondly it takes forever to uncover a space and I have so many butterflies in storage it just seems a waste."
"March 15, 2016",5,Rosa Murillo," Love It !! I'm a mother of two beautiful girls, and a stay at home mom. Sometimes you just need that one break and this is perfect for me. Very addicting and the ambient is so calming. Love Love it!!!"
"March 23, 2016",3,Jami Puetz,"Boring, hard to reach goals This game gets boring after a while. It is also impossible to reach certain goals if you don't have friends who play. There needs to be an option to make friends within the game, with other players."
"April 10, 2016",1,Thao Nguyen,Kicked Every time I try to play it its background is all black then I just kicks me out plz fix this I really like this game+I want the new event also emIling you doesn't help let me login!?! Plz help this is my one time favorite game. 😣😣😣😣😣 😭😭😭😭

I've owned flutter for about 4 years now, I played it on my ipod touch at first which worked almost perfectly but sadly that broke and I then had to wait about 2 years before possessing a device that is compatable, anyway I logged back in thinking great - all my rare butterflies,two bumble bees and a maxed out area to hatch all these new butterflies... sadly not the case - the game could not hack the information which was from such a huge gap in time and all I got was a repeated error"

"April 11, 2016",4,Julianne Arambula,It's an awesome game! I love how you progress and it's well designed. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that it only offers permanent accounts to people who connect to Facebook. I'd rather they give an option through Google accounts.

The only thing  I don't  like is the screen moving when I'm chasing pollen and the floating petal.  Update:  love this app, been using it for years.

It takes me to a webpage where there is no place to update, the green tab that normally says update says installed. What do I need to do to disconnect from this game circle on Google play and properly update? I am not able to play the game because I can't update"

I am seriously considering uninstalling now though, as somehow, after unlocking almost all of the Amore set butterflies, my game has reset to a point where I have the first butterfly sitting on a shelf as a caterpillar, and none of the rest of the set unlocked.

"January 25, 2016",5,Jenna Schopen,Amazing I love this game so much but one suggestion would be to have little mini games inside the game so that you can keep playing even when there's nothing else to do because eventually I just stare at the screen waiting to click bark bugs (such as a butterfly race)

"March 8, 2016",1,Lily Owen,Loved this game. Lost everything when received new tablet. Do not want fb!!! Shouldn't have to have it either just to save. Did email after it was suggested but no reply. :(

"December 15, 2015",5,Laurel Violet,"Fun and relaxing I initially got it to help with my anxiety, and it's been so good for that. The music is soothing and there is always some little task to do."
"December 25, 2015",3,Tami Day," It's usually a great app, but lately if I set my flower shifts or attract an egg I'll come back an hour later to see my action had been reversed and nothing's happened."

I have to open and close my game 3 times each time i want to play. My friends have given up on playing because of this bug. 2. ""The event is over"" popup appears and then the game closes: its unplayable. 3: the snail does not give rewards when watching vids. 4: Greed: The event couldn't be completed, when playing actively. Unless you pay a lot of cash."

"December 18, 2015",5,El Narrador de Orquideas,"Great, fun but missing photos I love collecting the butterflies. But will be great if we can also see real pictures of them. I am sure you have them and use them as a guide for the animations you have in the game. So why not add them as 6 step while leveling up the butterflies. That way we can see the beauty of the real ones."
"August 6, 2016",5,Karen Miller,Love it. I played this game before an love it. But when it came for me to up grade my tablet would not allow it. Made me sad.

"December 23, 2015",4,Ashley Haines,Separate folder for all butterflies You should make a 3rd folder so people can see all the butterflies at the same time still have the butterfly folder and storage folder but put an other folder for all. Just in case people have the same butterfly that can fuse

It has a peaceful ambience -- I love to play Flutter before bed as a way to calm my mind (though I play throughout the day too, haha). Also, I have never seen a game that includes so many free ways to gain the paid currency, which is amazing -- you can tell the game was made out of love and not as a money-grab."

You have to clear the foliage 5 times and the price goes higher every time you clear. it starts to get annoying when you have to store butterflies to make new ones because there's no space and not enough pollen to clear foliage.

"November 23, 2015",2,Nickee Knowhow,"Was great!!! It was a great game, even though they don't give out enough flutterbucks. Now this new aurum set has come I hate this game. The flowers don't even come. It's impossible to get the entire set. I always get the entire set on the other challenge."
"November 27, 2015",2,A Google user,I use to love it Don't buy flutter dollars. They are too expensive. Also I haven't been able to make a butterfly I want in months. And this is with 2x 50% and 1x 20. I'm considering deleting it. It's become that crap.

Also my Google+ friends are gone as well as Google+ is gone period. Fix this and I'll fix my rating but now I have no one to send or receive gifts with. I'm not Happy about this at all.
"September 24, 2015",2,Kiarah Van Zwam, Still the great game it was but the migration killed the graphic the Forrest and butterflies are blurry and the writing it very difficult to read I hope this gets fixed otherwise I don't think I can handle playing flutter for much longer
"September 26, 2015",5,Deborah Faye Lopez,Love it and obsessed This game got me through the first months of my son's life. I would not have stayed sane without it. Now he's a toddler and mommy still plays its while he sleeps lol
"September 24, 2015",4,Sharma Ibrahim,Graphics Nice game as always. One complaint. The text and graphics are blurry. Please fix this.
"September 23, 2015",1,Oulla O,"So long, Google+ Friends The new update doesn't offer support or even connect with Google+ only with Facebook. What a load of garbage."
"September 25, 2015",4,Janet Dunlap, Love this game but the migration left me with a new but very low resolution game. Low resolution makes numbers and letters hard to read and the beautiful environment less beautiful.  I hope a fix is forthcoming.
"September 24, 2015",3,Becca Reedy, Is now difficult to log out.... try to log out and I basically have to force shut down. I liked the older one better.

"September 24, 2015",5,bubble blubber,Wish I found it sooner Love this game! Totally wish I found it sooner. I do wish there were more ways to decorate otherwise there's nothing to do while you wait for butterflies to mature. I definitely love that it's fun but informative at the same time.

Yes, it may be hard to get certain things and flutterbucks, but there's always an all-access pass to more butterflies. Most beautiful game on Google Play and probably ever. Play Starlight too, you collect moths on there!"

They have made it less of a social game by taking away gifting opportunities.  The butterflies that reset the basic gifting process have become almost useless, removing multiple gifting.
