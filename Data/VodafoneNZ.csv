Firstly it doesn't display credit expiry dates so you can't see when you next need to top up before they will take your existing credit. The app also doesn't notify you when your credit is about to expire, even though there are notifications for just about everything else. Nor does it allow you to automatically top up your account by the minimum amount in order to avoid losing your credit."

But reading into the apps permissions it still is capable of using the camera when it wants. As well as other private things. Very disturbing and I'll be uninstalling, even though I need it. Not worth it. Poo vodafone."
"October 18, 2019",2,Mark Smith, Barely adequate. Used to work very well. They exchanged useful features for a pretty cover. Harder to use now but real pretty. Wastes time. Now I'm forced to upgrade without the option of waiting. Last time it failed to work so I'm leery about seeing this mandated upgrades.
"October 16, 2019",2,Rodney King," The app works well these days.. but I have had to change from Vodafone SIM to a different one to receive confirmation numerical texts from my bank. This is after several conversations with both sides. Each says it's not THEIR fault, it's the other's!"
"September 18, 2019",1,archie fabro, Vodafone doesn't sort out any issues. I called up support and reported the issue of my plan being renewed but after 2 minutes all my data and money are gone. They sorted it out the first time the it happened again.
"November 11, 2019",1,Natasha George, I think the app should allow you to still operate when no data available or credit so you don't have to use a recharge voucher or be in the presence of wifi.
"October 29, 2019",1,Anita Collie," Appears to be broken. App logs out immediately following log in ""to keep you secure"". So secure no one can use it. Please sort this out vodafone."
"October 16, 2019",1,Karen O'brien, I want to add money to my account and this notification on my vodafone page dies nit have a clise button. I cannot update this app with out deleting sonething off my phone and I am not ditching other apps that I use all the time to accomodate an update of this one
"October 16, 2019",2,Shereena Rolland, This app is a pain it keeps logging me out then locking me out and I have to wait to get to speak to someone from vodafone to get them to log me back in as it wont allow me to reset the password - SORT IT OUT VODAFONE!!!! Unhappy customer of 29 years
"October 26, 2019",4,Haych NZ," Actually works unlike the versions of old. Can't work out why there's a need for forced updates, not allowing you to login until you do update."
"October 18, 2019",4,Mr Edwards," I love the app but it would be cool if I could click on my bill when opening the PDF and read it offline using my PDF reader on the same device. Other than that, yeah pretty happy!"

"September 26, 2019",1,Josh rko, App keeps crashing even after Uninstalling and reinstalling over and over again. No point having an app when it won't even open. How am I meant to change phone plans. Go into the shop? What a hassle
"November 12, 2019",1,Saydee Mcvay, Dont force updates. Had to use my top up to update the app which used my credit and i had to top up again to then get my pack.

"October 8, 2019",2,Anton Oleinik, The app is now broken for couple of months. Tried uninstalling and dowloading again - still no go. Guys at vodafone shop confirmed that it is known issue. Not great.
"October 13, 2019",1,Antony Walker," App hasn't loaded for the last few updates, just stays at the red background with the white line tracing the Vodafone logo. Or is that all the app does now?"
"September 21, 2019",1,Brenda Denise King," I cannot access my vodafone since the last update. You want me to stay I suggest you fix it. I also have TV, landline and internet, so your call."

"October 21, 2019",2,Sarah M," App keeps closing each time I try to open it.. Very annoying, How can this be fixed???"
"October 9, 2019",2,Hayden Mckee, would be better that data requested is sent instead of getting data you don't want sent to you and being charged for it. Even get overcharged for what you want and what you get because of their sponsorship arrangements.
"October 16, 2019",1,regina hepi, I gave this rating because every time i put credit on using my data it chess 2 dollars worth before i even get to do my plan its so anoying

Even checking my Vodafone app doesn't help because the numbers don't match what Vodafone has. I was asked by their support to restart my phone, take out the sim, and wait 30s before turning on my phone so that they could see my usage update in their system. Is that a joke? Then was asked to log out and log back in to the app to see my usage."

"May 26, 2019",1,Daniel Reeves, used to work fine but past two months it wont let me log in. cant do anything with the app. vodafone help is useless they admit a technical issue and raise a ticket and never hear back from them. wouldn't recommend vodafone might be time to switch to someone who has decent customer service
"August 15, 2019",3,Faamalie Vili," App works fine. Only criticism would be the way data is displayed. for e.g when my data is low it shows 0.8gb, now I can't tell if that means I have only 8 or 800 megabytes left?

Payment took 5 times to work, got told my card didn't have funds which is 
bull and an insult, then next day it didn't auto reload and now if i do i 
lose my carry over txts. I have wasted time i do not have on your idiotic

of plan allowances."

can't cow your bills you can't pay your bills. Funny thing is they can text 
you to say pay your bill now or there will be penalties.... Absolutely 
disgusting service... Not surprised though."

The App and Services automatically detects your usage and if its Data your running short of, then it will not really offer good data top ups, And if it does it will charge an arm and a leg for you to have it for 30 days, Then theres those small annoying 300mb bundles, lasts only up until midnight REALLY !!! and for $3.00 wow, Look I haven't be able to find any good Deals Here.  Just do the math ?

I've ensured both the app and my phone are updated and have reported the fault but still no joy. Often freezes at other times. Basically the most unstable app I have.

Far too fast,  I was generally doing only web browsing and email.   When it ran out I purchased another $20 top-up.  The app showed a balance of $20 and no data available.   I rang vodaphone,  and got a Friday special 3Gb for $17 the app now sows a balance of shows a balance of $3 and no data credit.   I have no idea what my data balance is.   I am feeling that I have been overcharged outrageously.  But your app that is supposed to act like a fuel tank meter is defiantly faulty.   It shows no info whatever of the history of this payment period,  and very confusing info about"

I phoned customer support and in between your voice recording say uninstall and reinstall and your overseas call center saying that won't work nothing has been sorted. I would suggest firstly make an app that works and secondly make sure new Zealand and overseas are on the same page as to avoid Vodafone looking like a bunch of incompetent fools. I can't even get a plan started because overseas can't see my information and blame nz for the problem. Your overseas staff are rude and should be taught how to deal with customers.

"April 9, 2017",1,A Google user, Very weak UX. When switching plans there are buttons with no explanation and Vodafone wants you to hit the buy now now button that results in all the carry over data and mins getting lost.

"February 15, 2017",2,Peter Lough, I'm on a my flex plan for $23 per month but the app forces me through Auto top up to either top up $20 per month or $25 per month. As such I have to top up more than I need and this annoys me.

Hidden add-ons being added to my account which automatically deducted small amounts from my balance to force me to top up again.   I just had an incident where I topped up to refresh my plan as I ran out of txts. I had a balance of 2 cents and topped up 20 bucks. You would expect my balance to then be 20.02. Due to the app not updating the balance quickly I didn't realize this wasn't the case. It was only when I proceeded with the plan refresh and got charged another 20 bucks that I realized the balance wasn't as expected. I called support who informed me I had an add-on that charged $1 when I used 25mb of data.. whatever that means. Either way I've never heard of that add-on nor is it listed against my account or sold on the store. How sneaky.  I managed to get the money refunded but be warned. This sort of thing has happened way to often."

Can't you just show the renew date? Finally, the app seems to be not working so often, that i have to go on the computer to check anyway. The app is indicative of the way that vodafone operates now -  hopelessly."

[edit after developer reply: Yes, the phone was bought for me as a gift from Vodafone and yes, I know that's why I can't uninstall it. But simply because a phone is bought from Vodafone is not a good reason to have a vendor-based app on it which cannot be uninstalled. At the very least, in cases like mine the person who buys the phone as a gift might not know which network the individual they are buying for would prefer to use. People can move their mobile phones from one network to another, why should they be forced to keep the Vodafone app installed when they are no longer using Vodafone as a provider? One star.]"
