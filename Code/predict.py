"""
This file utilizes the Expectation Maximization of Multinomial NaÃ¯ve Bayes to predict the tags of the remaining 57-62 % of the reviews. 
This is the file that does the prediction of reviews with the support of naivebayes.py and seminb.py

Reviews will come in 2 data frames:
1. Untagged reviews (60%) - 1 column (reviews)
2. Tagged reviews (40%) - 2 columns (reviews, tag/label)
